As the main target of cyber warfare, the power industrial control system is always at the forefront of network attack and destruction. The existing security protection of china's power industrial control system mainly focuses on boundary protection. The security protection of the industrial control system itself is insufficient, and it is unable to effectively deal with the emergence of various high-concealment APT attacks. The application of new technologies such as the Internet of Things has further expanded the attack surface. According to the research idea of “reliable hardware, system immunity, unified framework, and controllable software”, this paper proposes an ontology security protection framework and key technologies for power industrial control system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Industrial control security; Ontology security; Reliable hardware; System","Computer crime; Control systems; Electric power system security; Industrial research; Ontology; Power control; Boundary protection; Cyber warfare; Industrial control systems; Key technologies; Network attack; Security frameworks; Security protection; Unified framework; Electric power system protection",,,,,,,,,"Zhang, C.Y., Yang, X.Y., Liang, W., Qi, Y.Z.: Research on attack threat analysis technology of power industrial control system.

The supply modulator (SM) is critical to fulfil the ET strategy. This paper provides a ripple tracking method based on an open-loop digital controller for SM with one switching amplifier (SA) to efficiently track the envelope of PA. The digital controller combines the strong abilities of caching the envelope signals in advance and the powerful envelope shaping as well as the filtering capability to conquer the intrinsic obstacle of close-loop delay, accelerating the tracking speed and decreasing the operation frequency of SM. The performance of SM is highly enhanced based on the proposed circuit model with error correction technique. The proposed ripple tracking method realizes excellent average power tracking (APT) performance compared with that of multi-level SM structure and decreases the hardware requirements, significantly. A test SA chip is fabricated with a standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology and the test platform of whole SM system is established. The measurement results show that the proposed platform achieves very high efficiency of 88% in tracking the envelope of 10-MHz 100-MHz OFDM baseband signals. © 2020 IEEE.","average power tracking; circuit modeling; digitally control; error correction; supply modulator","Efficiency; Error correction; Industrial electronics; Power amplifiers; Baseband signals; Correction techniques; Digital controllers; Digitally controlled; Envelope tracking; Operation frequency; Supply modulator; Switching amplifiers; Modulators",,,,,,,,,"Kim, B., Kim, J.J., Kim, D., Son, J., Cho, Y., Kim, J.S., Park, B., Push the envelope: Design concepts for envelope-tracking power amplifiers (2013) Ieee Microw.

A control strategy has been developed in this paper to control the converters at higher wind speed and the generator not exceeding the limiting torque. A slip-ring type induction machine is utilized in the DFIG mode for the proposed system. The other contribution of the paper is in the area of improving power quality issues e.g. Harmonics minimization introduced by Induction generator, converter switching's and the grid. Thus, this can reduce the THD making the system more apt to be integrated with the grid. SHEPWM based techniques are used with metaheuristic techniques to generate the switching angles for the inverter. This system can be used to serve the domestic/ industrial demands.

They play a critical role in the survival of our postmodern economies, as all other areas depend on their availability. An interruption in their operation may have a direct impact on the availability of other services (e.g., health, transportation). The problem is particularly intense when no backup networks are available, or the required recovery time is beyond backup autonomy. The transition to a decentralized management and control system for these networks requires digital technologies, advanced interconnected system communications, and Internet access. These technologies expose critical infrastructure networks to external threats that require careful assessment of cyber-security risks and appropriate countermeasures. An important factor that enhances the range of threats is the heterogeneity of Smart Grids, which incorporate industrial control systems such as the SCADA, distributed control system, and programmable logic controllers to which security improvements may not have been made since they were installed. Υet, another serious problem arises from the fact that older technologies were designed at times when cyber-security was not part of their technical design specifications. At the same time, it should be seriously considered that many of the systems of these networks that can be cyber-attacked may not be easily disconnected, as this could potentially lead to generalized operational problems. In this scientific research, a sophisticated active security framework is proposed, which is based solely on advanced computational intelligence methods and concerns the digital security of critical infrastructure networks. Specifically, this research introduces a sophisticated adaptive ensemble classification framework for real-time data streams by distributed control systems. It is a “Kappa” architecture framework that is based on a two-step online ensemble learning model based on bagging and boosting methods. The aim is performance of real-time analysis and evaluation of data flows from Smart Grids, toward the effective identification of APT attacks. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Advanced persistent threats; Ensemble learning; Industrial control systems; Kappa architecture; Smart energy grids","Classification (of information); Closed loop control systems; Computation theory; Critical infrastructures; Data flow analysis; Data streams; Distributed parameter control systems; Electric power transmission networks; Learning systems; Network architecture; Network security; Programmable logic controllers; Public works; Real time systems; Risk assessment; SCADA systems; Smart power grids; Advanced persistent threats; Architecture frameworks; Computational intelligence methods; Decentralized management; Ensemble classification; Ensemble learning; Industrial control systems; Smart energies; Adaptive control systems",,,,,,,,,"Babu, B., Ijyas, T., Muneer, P., Varghese, J., Security issues in SCADA based industrial control systems (2017) 2017 2Nd International Conference on Anti-Cyber Crimes (ICACC), Abha, 2017, pp. 47-51. , https://doi.org/10.1109/anti-cybercrime.2017.7905261; Haq, E.U., Xu, H., Pan, L., Khattak, M.I., Smart grid security: Threats and solutions (2017) 13Th International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grids (SKG), pp. 188-193. , https://doi.org/10.1109/skg.2017.00039, Beijing, China, 2017; Tan, S., De, D., Song, W.Z., Yang, J., Das, S.K., Survey of security advances in smart grid: a data driven approach (2017) IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 19 (1), pp. 397-422; Raj, V.S., Chezhian, R.M., Mrithulashri, M., Advanced persistent threats & recent high profile cyber threat encounters (2014) Int J Innovative Res Comput Commun Eng, 2 (1). , An ISO 3297: 2007 Certified Organization; Virvilis, N., Gritzalis, D., Apostolopoulos, T., Trusted computing vs. Advanced persistent threats: Can a defender win this game?

Critical infrastructures define goods, systems or subsystems that are essential to maintain the vital functions of society, health, physical protection, security plus economic and social well-being of citizens. The digital security of critical infrastructures is a very important priority for the well-being of every country, especially nowadays, because of the direct threats dictated by the current international conjuncture and due to the emerging interactions or interconnections developed between the National Critical Infrastructures, internationally. The aim of this research is the development and testing of an Anomaly Detection intelligent algorithm that has the advantage to run very fast with a small portion of the available data and to perform equally well with the existing approaches. Such a system must be characterized by high efficiency and very fast execution. Thus, we present the Gryphon advanced intelligence system. Gryphon is a Semi-Supervised Unary Anomaly Detection System for big industrial data which is employing an evolving Spiking Neural Network (eSNN) One-Class Classifier (eSNN-OCC). This machine learning algorithm corresponds to a model capable of detecting very fast and efficiently, divergent behaviors and abnormalities associated with cyberattacks, which are known as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). The training process is performed on data related to the normal function of a critical infrastructure. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Advanced persistent threat; Anomaly detection; Critical infrastructure; Evolving spiking neural network; Industrial control systems; One-class classification; SCADA; Semi-supervised learning","Critical infrastructures; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Public works; SCADA systems; Supervised learning; Well testing; Advanced persistent threat; Industrial control systems; One-class Classification; SCADA; Semi- supervised learning; Spiking neural networks; Anomaly detection",,,,,,,,,"Hurst, W., Merabti, M., Fergus, P., A survey of critical infrastructure security (2014) Critical Infrastructure Protection VIII.

Nowadays steganography, i.e. information hiding techniques are increasingly used by attackers in order to operate without being detected. The usage of hidden channel communication in APTs creates a novel form of attack scenarios for which the current defense mechanisms are usually ineffective. In order to defend industrial control systems against those attacks, it is necessary to understand and comprehend the attacks. Thus, this paper presents how attack modelling based on the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain can be used to analyze hidden channel APT attack scenarios and how it can be used to elaborate defense mechanisms and to reveal attack indicators along all phases of those attack scenarios.

WSS is the cyber-physical systems, that operate within the OSI model. The specificity and specialization of these systems are determined by radio technologies of the physical layer. For example, the Internet of Things (IoT, including medical IoMT), the Internet of Drones (IoD), systems for aviation monitoring ADS-B and traffic management ATM, and, in the future, the Internet of Everything (IoE) - all are types of WSS. The aim is to analyze the radio frequency parameters of information and control interaction in the WSS to identify possible radio frequency cyber vulnerabilities in the WSS. Objectives: summarize and systematize the physical and functional parameters of wireless technologies in the ISM (Industrial Scientific & Medical Band) and SRD (Short range devices) ranges, which are significant from the WSS radiofrequency cyber vulnerability perspective, including navigation technologies; analyze trends and methods of successful cyber attacks on the WSS; carry out expert assessments of potential WSSs cyber vulnerabilities depending on their architecture and application area. The methods used: analysis of trends in known radiofrequency incidents and expert assessments of the cyber vulnerability of the WSS information and control interaction channels. The following results were obtained: 12 actual WSS radio technologies were analyzed. 6 types of possible radio frequency cyber attacks on the WSS were typified. The expert assessment of the probability of exploiting vulnerabilities by ranges, radio technologies, and attack type was made. The special danger of high-tech targeted APT attacks, as well as the high potential radio vulnerability of cyber-physical systems, was shown. The cyber vulnerability of ADS-B aircraft systems was especially noted. Conclusions. The scientific novelty of the results obtained is as follows: a trend of APT attacks cost reduction and an increase in the probability of their implementation through the new capabilities of SDR technology (Software Defined Radio) were revealed. The possibility of a controlled SDR compromising of the security parameters of WSS channels in any radio range was shown. A promising direction of research was proposed - SDR-penetration testing of WSS. © 2020.

This makes mandatory to develop advanced security services beyond traditional solutions, being Opinion Dynamics one of them. This novel approach proposes a multi-agent collaborative framework that permits to trace an APT throughout its entire life-cycle, as formerly analyzed. In this paper, we introduce TI&TO, a two-player game between an attacker and defender that represents a realistic scenario where both compete for the control of the resources within a modern industrial architecture. By validating this technique using game theory, we demonstrate that Opinion Dynamics consists in an effective first measure to deter and minimize the impact of an APT against the infrastructure in most cases. To achieve this, both attacker and defense models are formalized and an equitable score system is applied, to latter run several simulation test cases with different strategies and network configurations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced Persistent Threat; Defense; Detection; Game theory; Opinion Dynamics; Response","Cryptography; Ecosystems; Game theory; Life cycle; Multi agent systems; Collaborative framework; Entire life cycles; Industrial architecture; Industrial ecosystems; Network configuration; Opinion dynamics; Realistic scenario; Security services; Network security",,,,,"777996

Episodes like Stuxnet, Irongate, BlackEnergy3, etc., showed that cyberattacks causing kinetic effects have become a concrete threat. This is particularly concerning in relation to the chemical process industry (CPI) as disruptions could involve the release of hazardous materials and result in catastrophic effects. So far, OT-targeted cyber-attacks are considered so complex that only sophisticated teams with significant technical and organisational resources are likely to succeed. This paper provides a critical review of the most relevant elements with a focus on the petrol-chemical sector. It will first discuss why OT is inherently insecure. It will then analyse how the cyber-threat has evolved and it will review relevant OT-targeted cyberattacks. Finally, it will introduce the concept of advanced persistent threats (APT) and discuss their characterisation and modus operandi. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Existing researchers believe that theft of sensitive data is one of the important goals of APT attacks. In order to accurately identify the stealing behavior of the APT attack, a spatio-temporal association analysis is proposed to detect the APT attack in industrial network, which includes association rules mining, historical data retrieval and feature classification. Firstly, FP-Growth Algorithm on APT attack’s temporal features, spatial features and category features is adopted to mine the association rules. And then, the relation between APT attack’s features is analyzed, and the rules are explained semantically in combination with the features of APT attack historical data retrieval method based on Bloom filter algorithm. Finally, a multi-feature spatial weighted combined SVM classification detection algorithm which is used to detect abnormal APT attack session flows. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm has a good ability to detect hidden APT attacks, and the multi-feature spatial weighted combined SVM classification detection algorithm has higher detection accuracy and lower false alarm rate than traditional single classification detection, and it is also safe for industrial control security. In addition, our proposed algorithm uses less space and could judge whether the data is in the current data set rapidly. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Advanced persistent threat; Association analysis; Attack detection; Industrial network security; Spatio-temporal feature","Association rules; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Filtration; Intrusion detection; Network security; Signal detection; Support vector machines; Association rules mining; Bloom-filter algorithms; Detection algorithm; Feature classification; FP-growth algorithm; Industrial controls; Industrial networks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Feature extraction",,,,,"ZY20180123

Besides, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack utilizing complex types of attack in order to attack a certain target brings about a tremendous chaos on a national and social level. Under such a situation, a necessity for ESM (Enterprise Security Management) is emphasized to establish multi-network enterprise security systems for a defense against an attack from outside and an efficient management. However, ESM analyzed and collected data, with the main focus on information security system-based security event and network sensor-based harmful traffic event without carrying out a function to analyze a general system and application log-based event. As far as an effective security detection is concerned, strategies for a systemic preparation and execution to actively solve the security issue are necessary by utilizing enormous big data occurring throughout the enterprise IT infrastructure sectors. In this regard, this study is to present a security log analysis system utilizing SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) system to cope with an advanced attack that the existing ESM can hardly detect. SIEM is going to analyze an association between data and security event occurring in major IT infrastructure facility network, system, applied services and a great deal of information security systems, and then to present the methods for identifying, in advance, potential security threat. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","APT; ESM; Event management; Security information; SIEM",,,,,,,,,,"Ha, L.S., Won, K.S., Hong, K.K., Sechung, P., Design of big data ETL model for aggregating of security log/event (2014) KICS, No. 06; Kavanagh, K.M., Nicolett, M., Rochford, O., Magic quadrant for security information and event management (2014) Gartner Group, No. 06; Nicolett, M., Feiman, J., SIEM Enables Enterprise Security Intelligence (2011) Gartner Group, No. 01; Macdonald, N., Information Security Is Becoming a (2012) Big Data Analytics Problem.

APTs attack ICS in such a way that they are detected after a long time in the system. This paper proposes the use of the biological immune system as a foundation for developing ICS security architecture because the biological immune system is renowned for defending the body from pathogens. The paper compares how the Biological Immune System (BIS) defends the body from pathogens and how ICS are secured from invasion by any attack. By considering the similarities and differences between ICS security and the BIS operation and taking into consideration current research on ICS security a bio-immunology inspired security model to defend ICS was designed. The proposed model was designed using design science research and initial results are presented in this paper. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020","Advanced persistent threats; Biological immune system; Industrial control system; Security","Artificial intelligence; Control systems; Advanced persistent threats; Biological immune system; Design-science researches; Industrial control systems; Security; Security Architecture; Security model; Immune system",,,,,,,,,"Piggin, R.S.H., Emerging good practice for cyber security of industrial control systems and SCADA (2012) 7Th IET International Conference on System Safety, Incorporating the Cyber Security Conference 2012, pp. 1-6; Bere, M., A preliminary review of ICS security frameworks and standards versus advanced persistent threats (2015) Iccws 2015—The Proceedings of the 10Th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security: ICCWS2015; Targeted cyberattacks logbook, https://apt.securelist.com/#!/threats; Bere, M., Muyingi, H., Initial investigation of industrial control system (ICS) security using artificial immune system (AIS) (2015) International Conference on Emerging Trends in Networks and Computer Communications (ETNCC), pp. 79-84. , pp., 2015; Edgar, D.J.M., Master Medicine: Immunology: A Core Text with Self-Assessment; Parham, P., (2009) The Immune System.

Although there is scope to collect security logs by using traditional IT technology, this is challenging for special ICS devices such as a programmable logic controller (PLC). PLCs are the major target of APT in ICS because physical damage can be caused by connecting directly with sensors or actuators. According to NIST SP 800-92 [4], that provides importance of log management in computer security, security logs generated from PLCs also need to be managed to enhance ICS security. Therefore, this study analyzes how to collect various information on PLCs. Additionally, we experimented with collecting system logs from a PLC that provides system information via a web interface, and the results are described. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Cyber-Physical System; DCS; PLC; Security Log Collection","Computer circuits; Controllers; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Programmable logic controllers; Programmed control systems; Security of data; Collecting systems; Industrial control systems; Integrated monitoring systems; It technologies; Physical damages; Programmable logic controllers (PLC); Sensors or actuators; System information; Intelligent control",,,,,,,,,"Choi, S., Kim, Y., Yun, J., Min, B., Kim, H., Data-driven field mapping of heterogeneous security events for integrated monitoring (2019) Thirteenth Annual IFIP WG 11.10 International Conference on Critical Infrastructure Protection.; Choi, S., Lee, W., Shin, H., Yun, J., Kim, S., Poster: Cps security testbed development using controller-in-the-middle (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS '18)., pp. 829-831. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3196494.3201589, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Falliere, N., Murchu, L.O., Chien, E., W32. stuxnet dossier (2011) White Paper, Symantec Corp., Security Response, 5 (6), p. 29. , 2011; Kent, K., Souppaya, M.P., (2006) SP 800-92: Guide to Computer Security Log Management., , (2006); (2015) Which Information Is Entered in the Diagnostic Buffer of the SIMATIC S7 CPU with STEP 7, , https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/14960968/, Retrieved April 15, 2019 from","Choi, J.; Affiliated Institute of ETRISouth Korea; email: jwchoi5790@nsr.re.kr",,"ACM SIGSAC","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","2019 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security, AsiaCCS 2019","9 July 2019 through 12 July 2019",,149315,,9781450367523,,,"English","AsiaCCS - Proc.

By exploring network threat intention, a system dynamic transition decision-making mechanism is formed to implement the dynamic and uncertain structure of network information system. Thus, the active security defense of network information system can be realized based on existing hardware and software environment with vulnerabilities and backdoors.

This requires the development of advanced cyber-security services that can holistically detect and trace these attacks, beyond traditional solutions. In this sense, Opinion Dynamics has been proven as an effective solution, as they can locate the most affected areas within the industrial network. With this information, it is possible to put in place accurate response techniques to limit the impact of attacks on the infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the applicability of Opinion Dynamics to trace an APT throughout its entire life cycle, by correlating different anomalies over time and accounting for the persistence of threats and the criticality of resources. Moreover, we run various experiments with this novel technique over a testbed that models a real control system, thereby assessing its effectiveness in an actual industrial scenario. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, due to an untrusted server in a cloud, the access control turns out to be the challenging issue to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data. The ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is deliberated to be an apt technique to enforce the access control for encrypted cloud outsourced data. But, due to the computation complexity of decryption, user revocation and complexity of key management for achieving granularity, prevailing CP-ABE schemes when applied directly to multi authority attribute system, incurs more computational costs in the order of NP. In this paper, an efficient CP-ABE based multi authority attribute system is put forth that supports decryption and user revocation by CSP with the advent of a blind encryption/decryption technique and a novel colouring scheme for predicting user behaviour analysis. Security and performance of ERAC-MAC was analysed and found to be much better than the other prevailing schemes. The implementation was done using the paring based cryptography library of the Stanford University in Ubuntu environment. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Attribute authority; Attribute revocation; Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption; CP-ABE; Multi attribute authority",,,,,,,,,,"Avallone, S., Guadagno, S., Emma, D., Ventre, G., D-ITG distributed internet traffic generator (2004) Proceedings of the First International Conference on the Quantitative Evaluation of Systems, QEST 2004, pp. 316-317. , IEEE.20, September; AWS Public Datasets, , http://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/, (accessed January 2015); Bethencourt, J., Sahai, A., Waters, B., Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, SP'07, pp. 321-334. , IEEE, May; Boldyreva, A., Goyal, V., Kumar, V., Identity-based encryption with efficient revocation (2008) Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 417-426. , ACM, October; Chase, M., Multi-authority attribute based encryption (2007) Theory of Cryptography, pp. 515-534. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Dong, C., Russello, G., Dulay, N., Shared and searchable encrypted data for untrusted servers (2011) Journal of Computer Security, 19 (3), pp. 367-397; Goyal, V., Attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control of encrypted data (2006) Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Li, J., Yao, W., Zhang, Y., Qian, H., Han, J., Flexible and fine-grained attribute-based data storage in cloud computing (2017) IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, 10 (5), pp. 785-796; Li, M., Yu, S., Zheng, Y., Ren, K., Lou, W., Scalable and secure sharing of personal health records in cloud computing using attribute-based encryption (2013) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 24 (1), pp. 131-143; Lin, H., Cao, Z., Liang, X., Shao, J., Secure threshold multi authority attribute based encryption without a central authority (2010) Information Sciences, 180 (13), pp. 2618-2632; (2015) Nuclear Decommisioning Report, , http://ndreport.com/managing-nuclearinformation-in-the-cloud/, (accessed January 2015); Perlman, R., File system design with assured delete (2005) Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Security in Storage Workshop, SISW'05, p. 6. , IEEE, December; Pirretti, M., Traynor, P., McDaniel, P., Waters, B., Secure attribute-based systems (2006) Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 99-112. , ACM, October; Senthilkumar, S., Viswanatham, V.M., HB-PPAC: Hierarchy-based privacy preserving access control technique in public cloud (2017) International Journal of High Performance Computing and Networking, 10 (1-2), pp. 13-22; Senthilkumar, S., Viswanatham, M., Vinothini, M., HS-TBAC: A highly secured token based access control for outsourced data in cloud (2015) Proceedings of the International Conference on Innovation Information in Computing Technologies (ICIICT), pp. 1-3. , IEEE, February; Stallings, W., (2006) Cryptography and Network Security, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Wan, Z., Liu, J.E., Deng, R.H., HASBE: A hierarchical attribute-based solution for flexible and scalable access control in cloud computing (2012) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 7 (2), pp. 743-754; Wang, G., Liu, Q., Wu, J., Guo, M., Hierarchical attribute-based encryption and scalable user revocation for sharing data in cloud servers (2011) Computers and Security, 30 (5), pp. 320-331; Xu, Z., Martin, K.M., Dynamic user revocation and key refreshing for attribute-based encryption in cloud storage (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom), pp. 844-849. , IEEE, June; Yan, Z., Li, X., Wang, M., Vasilakos, A., Flexible data access control based on trust and reputation in cloud computing (2017) IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, 5 (3), pp. 485-498; Yang, K., Jia, X., Expressive, efficient, and revocable data access control for multi-authority cloud storage (2014) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 25 (7), pp. 1735-1744; Yang, K., Jia, X., Dac-macs: Effective data access control for multi-authority cloud storage systems (2014) Security for Cloud Storage Systems, pp. 59-83. , Springer, New York","Senthilkumar, S.; Vellore of Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: sudha.s@vit.ac.in",,,"Inderscience Publishers",,,,,1748569X,,,,"English","Int.

ICS is a general term for different control systems like Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Process Control Systems (PCS), and Smart grid. ICSs are used in mining industries, transportation systems, and for the distribution of water, natural gas, oil, electricity, and communications, in specialised facilities such as nuclear plants and for automating many other facilities. In a quest to find tangible solutions to the APT problem in information technology systems, many solutions have been designed to detect and protect against, as well as recover from APT. This paper endeavoured to survey the different techniques that have been designed to solve APT problems and their levels of success. This paper therefore discusses APT defence techniques. It is noted that many APTs use social engineering techniques to gain entry into systems; however, technical solutions are being developed to try and correct human errors that enable APTs to infiltrate ICS. Technical solutions include tweaking existing security controls, anomaly detection techniques and defence-in-depth techniques. The researchers believe that the defence-in-depth approach is the future of security and thus, suggest further improvements in defence-in-depth approaches by emulating the immune system which uses a layered defence mechanism to protect the human body from pathogens. Since the main research focused on APTs that are attacking ICS, a control system was setup to find the level of effectiveness of emulating immune system properties. This paper gives some preliminary results on how ICS which exhibit immune system properties perform better than those that are not. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

Thus, networked industrial control systems (NICS) are exposed to many security threats. Moreover, new technologies for NICS also need to be tested. This paper presents a cloud-based experimental platform for NICS to test new technologies and security threats. A cloud platform is used to emulate network devices and Simulink is used to simulate the physical layer. To build this testbed, we modify the cloud platform and add three modules to the testbed. One module is used so that the cloud platform can connect to real devices. By using this module, real devices can be added to the networks in the cloud platform. The second module is used for network connection configurations in the testbed. By using this module, the bandwidth, delay and packet loss rate for networks in the testbed can all be set. The third module is used to connect the Simulink to the testbed. The main features of the proposed platform are high flexibility, high authenticity, and low cost. Advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks are a common threat for NICS nowadays. In order to prove the feasibility of the proposed testbed, a common NICS is established and an APT attack is executed on it. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","cloud; NICS; security threats; testbed","Clouds; Network layers; Security systems; Testbeds; Delay and packet loss; Experimental platform; Industrial control systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Network connection; Networking technology; NICS; Security threats; Networked control systems",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61672264

Thus, the protection of utilities that provision critical services (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) is of vital importance given the severity imposed by any failure of these services. Recent security incidents in the context of critical infrastructures indicate that threats in such environments appear to be increasing both in frequency and intensity. The complexity of typical critical infrastructures is among the factors that make these environments vulnerable to threats. One of the most problematic types of threat is an advanced persistent threat (APT). This usually refers to a sophisticated, targeted, and costly attack that employs multiple attack vectors to gain access to the target system, then to operate in stealth mode when penetration is achieved, and to exfiltrate data or cause failures inside the system. In this chapter, we demonstrate how a set of processes developed in the context of HyRiM’s framework can assist in minimizing the damage caused to a utility organization that is subjected to an APT style of attack. Specifically, the framework is demonstrated using data from a real-world water utility network and an industrial control system (ICS) test-bed, and in which optimal defensive strategies are investigated. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",,,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/R00692X/1

A smart grid is an energy transmission and distribution network enhanced through digital control, monitoring, and telecommunication capabilities. It provides a real-time, two-way flow of energy and information to all stakeholders in the electricity chain, from the generation plant to the commercial, industrial, and residential end user. New digital equipment and devices can be strategically deployed to complement existing equipment. Using a combination of centralized IT and distributed intelligence within critical system control nodes ranging from thermal and renewable plant controls to grid and distribution utility servers to cities, commercial and industrial infrastructures, and homes a smart grid can bring unprecedented efficiency and stability to the energy system. Information and communication infrastructures will play an important role in connecting and optimizing the available grid layers. Grid operation depends on control systems called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) that monitor and control the physical infrastructure. At the heart of these SCADA systems are specialized computers known as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). There are destructive cyber-attacks against SCADA systems as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) were able to take over the PLCs controlling the centrifuges, reprogramming them in order to speed up the centrifuges, leading to the destruction of many and yet displaying a normal operating speed in order to trick the centrifuge operators and finally can not only shut things down but can alter their function and permanently damage industrial equipment. This paper proposes a computational intelligence System for Identification Cyber-Attacks on the Smart Energy Grids (SICASEG). It is a big data forensics tool which can capture, record, and analyze the smart energy grid network events to find the source of an attack to both prevent future attacks and perhaps for prosecution. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Advanced persistent threats; Big data; Cyber-attacks; Forensics tool; Smart energy grids; Supervisory control and data acquisition—SCADA",,,,,,,,,,"Blumsack, S., Fernandez, A., Ready or not, here comes the smart grid!

This exposes ICSs to modern advanced cyber threats. Existing security solutions try to prevent, detect, and react to cyber threats by employing security measures that typically do not cross the organization's boundaries. However, novel targeted multi-stage attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) take advantage of the interdependency between organizations. By exploiting vulnerabilities of various systems, APT campaigns intrude several organizations using them as stepping stones to reach the target infrastructure. A coordinated effort to timely reveal such attacks, and promptly deploy mitigation measures is therefore required. Organizations need to cooperatively exchange security-relevant information to obtain a broader knowledge on the current cyber threat landscape and subsequently obtain new insight into their infrastructures and timely react if necessary. Cyber security operation centers (SOCs), as proposed by the European NIS directive, are being established worldwide to achieve this goal. CI providers are asked to report to the responsible SOCs about security issues revealed in their networks. National SOCs correlate all the gathered data, analyze it and eventually provide support and mitigation strategies to the affiliated organizations. Although many of these tasks can be automated, human involvement is still necessary to enable SOCs to adequately take decisions on occurring incidents and quickly implement counteractions. In this paper we present a collaborative approach to cyber incident information management for gaining situational awareness on interconnected European CIs. We provide a scenario and an illustrative use-case for our approach; we propose a system architecture for a National SOC, defining the functional components and interfaces it comprises. We further describe the functionalities provided by the different system components to support SOC operators in performing incident management tasks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber incident handling; Cyber incident reporting; Cyber security; Information sharing; Security operation center","Complex networks; Critical infrastructures; Intelligent control; Knowledge management; Network security; Public works; Societies and institutions; Cyber incident handling; Cyber incident reporting; Cyber security; Information sharing; Security operation center; Information management",,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, I., Obermeier, S., Naedele, M., Richard, G.G., III, Scada systems: challenges for forensic investigators (2012) Comput, 12, pp. 44-51; Bethencourt, J., Sahai, A., Waters, B., Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (2007) Security and privacy, 2007.

In this context, graph theory can be applied to model the interaction among nodes and the complex attacks affecting them, as well as to design recovery techniques that ensure the survivability of the network. Accordingly, we leverage a decision model to study how a set of hierarchically selected nodes can collaborate to detect an APT within the network, concerning the presence of changes in its topology. Moreover, we implement a response service based on redundant links that dynamically uses a secret sharing scheme and applies a flexible routing protocol depending on the severity of the attack. The ultimate goal is twofold: ensuring the reachability between nodes despite the changes and preventing the path followed by messages from being discovered. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Advanced; Attack; Consensus; Detection; Dynamics; Opinion; Persistent; Redundant; Response; Secret; Sharing; Threat; Topology","Automation; Complex networks; Dynamics; Error detection; Graph theory; Security of data; Security systems; Advanced; Attack; Consensus; Opinion; Persistent; Redundant; Response; Secret; Sharing; Threat; Topology",,,,,"P11-TIC-07223

These threats are primarily related to the specific tasks these applications perform, such as their distinct design specifications, the specialized communication protocols they use and the heterogeneous devices they are required to interconnect. In particular, specialized attacks can undertake mechanical control, dynamic rearrangement of centrifugation or reprogramming of devices in order to accelerate or slow down their operations. This may result in total industrial equipment being destroyed or permanently damaged. Cyber-attacks against Industrial Control Systems which mainly use Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) combined with Distributed Control Systems are implemented with Programmable Logic Controllers. They are characterized as Advanced Persistent Threats. This paper presents an advanced Spiking One-Class Anomaly Detection Framework (SOCCADF) based on the evolving Spiking Neural Network algorithm. This algorithm implements an innovative application of the One-class classification methodology since it is trained exclusively with data that characterize the normal operation of ICS and it is able to detect divergent behaviors and abnormalities associated with APT attacks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Anomaly detection; APT; Evolving Spiking Neural Network; Industrial Control Systems; One-class classification; PLC; SCADA","Control systems; Data acquisition; Distributed parameter control systems; Information systems; Network security; Neural networks; Programmable logic controllers; Real time systems; SCADA systems; Anomaly detection; Industrial control systems; One-class Classification; SCADA; Spiking neural networks; Intelligent control",,,,,,,,,"Falco, J., IT security for industrial control systems (2002) NIST Internal Report (NISTIR), p. 6859. , http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=821684; Bailey, D., Wright, E., (2003) Practical SCADA for Industry; Boyer, S., (2010) SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, , 4th edn.

These currents cause abominable effects in electronics devices and develop voltage at motor shaft. When voltage exceeds dielectric breakdown voltage of lubricant film, it develops a huge bearing current which can damage bearings in very short interval. This paper emphasis on mitigation of CM currents and bearing currents by minimizing CMV produced by inverter-motor system based on selection and refinement of PWM algorithm without any additional hardware change. Multilevel inverters are apt for industrial applications due to low voltage distortion and less stress on switching devices than conventional two level inverter. To Investigate the effects on CMV, CM currents, bearing currents and motor shaft voltage, a high frequency Induction Motor (IM) model was chosen and analysis was done with different PWM techniques. The present work focused on three level Diode Clamped MultiLevel Inverter (DCMLI) and proposed new Space vector Pulse width Modulation (SVPWM) by choosing reductant CMV vectors in combination with sequence of changing one state in phase during switching transition. The proposed SVPWM technique shows the effectiness to reduce CMV as well as Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) and validated using MATLAB simulations. © 2016 IEEE.",,"AC motors; Capacitance; Electric breakdown; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; MATLAB; Motion control; Power control; Power electronics; Pulse width modulation; Vector spaces; Voltage control; Diode-clamped multilevel inverters; Electronics devices; High frequency induction; Magnetic interference; Parasitic capacitance; Space vector pulse width modulation; Switching transitions; Three-level inverters; Induction motors",,,,,,,,,"Ogasawara, S., Ayano, H., Akagi, H., Measurement and reduction of EMI radiated by a PWM inverter-fed ac motor drive system (1997) IEEE Trans. on Industrial Applications, 33 (4). , July/August; Chen, S., Lipo, T.A., Fitzgerald, D., Modeling of motor bearing currents in PWM inverter drives (1995) Proc.

Beyond the control flexibility, the power electronics devices (e.g., diode rectifiers) are also the main harmonic source to the grid due to their nonlinearity, which thus deteriorates the power grid quality and also lowers the conversion efficiency. Both degradations are apt to occur in motor drive applications. At present, many industrial drives are equipped with three-phase diode rectifiers and employ passive filtering techniques on the ac or the dc side of the rectifier. In such topologies, it is difficult to implement the prior-Art harmonic control strategies. Moreover, the total cost and complexity has become the main obstacle for these harmonic elimination approaches in multiple drive systems. Therefore, in this paper, a new cost-effective harmonic mitigation approach has been proposed for multiple drives. The proposed approach can control the generated current harmonics by benefiting of the nonlinearity of the drive units and through a novel current modulation scheme. The obtained results at the simulation and the experimental level validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.","active filters; Adjustable speed drives; current modulation; harmonic mitigation; multiple drives; three-phase rectifiers","Active filters; Cost effectiveness; Drives; Electric drives; Electric motors; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric rectifiers; Harmonic analysis; Modulation; Power electronics; Quality control; Rectifying circuits; Adjustable speed drives; Adjustable speed motor drives; Current modulation; Harmonic mitigation; Motor drive applications; Power electronics devices; Three phase diode rectifier; Three-phase rectifiers; Variable speed drives",,,,,,,,,"Waide, P., Brunner, C.U., Energy-efficiency policy opportunities for electric motor-driven systems (2011) Proc.

Wide use of modern IT technologies enables cyber attacks to disrupt the operation of ICS. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are the most threatening attacks to ICS due to their long persistence and destructive cyber-physical effects to ICS. This paper considers a simulation of attackers and defenders of an ICS, where the defender must consider the cost-effectiveness of implementing defensive measures within the system in order to create an optimal defense. The aim is to identify the appropriate deployment of a specific defensive strategy, such as defense-in-depth or critical component defense. The problem is represented as a strategic competitive optimisation problem, which is solved using a co-evolutionary particle swarm optimisation algorithm. Through the development of optimal defense strategy, it is possible to identify when each specific defensive strategies is most appropriate; where the optimal defensive strategy depends on the resources available and the relative effectiveness of those resources. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Control systems; Cost effectiveness; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Critical component; Defense in depth; Defensive measures; Defensive strategies; Industrial control systems; Industrial processs; Optimisation problems; Particle swarm optimisation algorithms; Intelligent control",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/L021013/1","This work is funded by the EPSRC project RITICS: Trustworthy Industrial Control Systems (EP/L021013/1).",,,"(2014), www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/downloads/techniker/hardware/BSI-CS005E.pdf, March; Chopitea, T., (2012) Threat Modelling of Hacktivist Groups Organization, Chain of Command, and Attack Methods, , http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/173222/173222.pdf; (2011), www.ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/documents/DHSCommonCybersecurityVulnerabilitiesICS20110523.pdf; Durkota, K., Lisy, V., Kiekintveld, C., Bosansky, B., Game-theoretic algorithms for optimal network security hardening using attack graphs (2015) Proceedings of International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pp. 1773-1774; Eberhart, R.C., Kennedy, J., A new optimizer using particle swarm theory (1995) Proceedings of 6Th International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Science, 1, pp. 39-43. , New York; Falliere, N., Murchu, L.O., Chien, E., Stuxnet dossier.

To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security.

In order to find solutions to mitigate APT attacks it is important to understand APT anatomy. This paper proposes an APT testing model developed using design research methodology that can be used to develop industrial control security (ICS) mechanisms. The model development followed three steps; identifying the components; identifying and explaining the characteristics in each component and developing the model. Six components were identified to be included in the model; reconnaissance, injection, installation, operation, command and control and termination. The model proposed is envisaged as systematic approach to testing and validation of security mechanisms that are aimed at APT detection in ICS. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Advanced persistent threats; Attacks; Industrial control system; Security; Threats","Control systems; Industrial research; Advanced persistent threats; Attacks; Industrial control systems; Security; Threats; Intelligent control",,,,,,,,,"Knapp, E., (2011) Industrial Network Security: Securing Critical Infrastructure Networks for Smart Grid, Scada, and Other Industrial Control Systems.

Beyond the control flexibility, the power electronics devices (e.g., diode rectifiers) are also the main harmonic source to the grid due to their nonlinearity, which deteriorate the power grid quality and may cause unnecessary losses in power system transformers. Both degradations are apt to occur in motor drive applications. As a consequence, it calls for advanced and intelligent control strategies for the power electronics based drive systems like adjustable speed drives in industry. At present, many industrial drives are still equipped with three-phase diode rectifiers. Thus, it is difficult to implement the prior-art harmonic control strategies for active front-ends. Moreover, the total cost and complexity has become an obstacle for these harmonic elimination approaches in multiple drive systems. Therefore, in this paper, a new cost-effective harmonic mitigation approach has been proposed for multiple drives. The proposed approach can control the generated current harmonics by benefiting of the nonlinearity of the drive units and through a novel current modulation scheme. Simulation and experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of harmonic elimination in three-phase multi-drive systems. © 2015 IEEE.","adjustable speed drives; harmonic elimination; multiple drives; three-phase rectifiers","AC motors; Cost effectiveness; Drives; Electric drives; Electric motors; Electric power transmission networks; Electric rectifiers; Electronics industry; Energy conversion; Harmonic analysis; Power control; Power electronics; Quality control; Rectifying circuits; Variable speed drives; Adjustable speed drives; Harmonic elimination; Harmonic mitigation; Intelligent control strategies; Motor drive applications; Power electronics devices; Three phase diode rectifier; Three-phase rectifiers; Electric power system control",,,,,,,,,"Bose, B.K., Power electronics and motor drives recent progress and perspective (2009) IEEE Trans.

Just like any other computer system ICS are vulnerable to attacks which can compromise the infrastructure and or the system components of ICS. Consequently the process being controlled is affected by the attacks. ICS are secured by following best practices and recommendations from ICS security frameworks and standards. It would seem that after implementing and adhering to best practices ICS would be secure and difficult to gain access to, but this is not the case because ICS are being compromised by a new kind of threat christened ""Advanced Persistent Threats"" (APT). An APT is a multi-step attack designed to realise a particular objective. All the traditional methods of detecting attacks like firewalls, intrusion detection systems and antivirus scanners fail to detect APTs before they have realised their objective. This implies that following ICS security best practices which recommend the use of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus scanners is not enough to deter APTs. This paper will highlight why ICS security frameworks and standards are not sufficient for securing ICS from APTS and will propose possible methods of securing ICS from APTs.","Advanced persistent threat; Industrial control systems","Computer crime; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Control systems; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Network security; Process control; Scanning; Standards; Advanced persistent threat; Industrial control systems; Industrial processs; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-step attacks; Security Best Practices; Security frameworks; System components; Intelligent control",,,,,,,,,"Averbuch, A., Siboni, G., The classic cyber defense methods have failed - What comes next (2013) Military and Strategic Affairs, 5 (MAY), pp. 45-58. , Available from Directory of Open Access Journals.

It is a suitable option notably in developing countries as it is simple, sustainable and cost effective. In the present lab-based batch study the free floating aquatic plant water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) is used for treatment of parboiled rice mill wastewater having low pH, high chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, and phosphate. In raw rice mill wastewater (undiluted) growth of water lettuce is found to be inhibited. Later on, two different dilution approaches (raw and facultative pond effluent 1:1; raw and tap water 1:1) are applied in order to effectively use this technology. In all cases a control (without plant) is maintained to compare the performance with the Aquatic Plant based Treatment (APT) system. In the APT system results reveal that removal of soluble COD (SCOD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and soluble phosphorus (sol. P) are upto 65%, 98%, 70%, and 65% respectively. The study highlights the efficacy of water lettuce in removing organics and nutrients from parboiled rice mill wastewater. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","eutrophic water; nutrients; rice mill wastewater; water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes)","Pistia stratiotes; industrial waste; waste water; water pollutant; analysis; Araceae; bioremediation; chemistry; food industry; industrial waste; metabolism; Oryza; procedures; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; Araceae; Biodegradation, Environmental; Food-Processing Industry; Industrial Waste; Oryza; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"Industrial Waste; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,,"Akinbile, C.O., Yousoff, M.S., Assessing Water Hyacinth (Eichornia crassopes) and Water Lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) effectiveness in aquaculture wastewater treatment (2012) International Journal of Phytoremediation, 14, pp. 201-211; Awuah, E., Oppong-Peprah, M., Lubberding, H.J., Gijzen, H.J., Comparative performance studies of water lettuce, duckweed and algal based stabilization ponds using low strength sewage (2004) Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health Part A, 67, pp. 1727-1739; (2005) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , 21st ed., Washington(DC): American Public Health Association; Behera, M., Jana, P.S., More, T.T., Ghangrekar, M.M., Rice mill wastewater treatment in microbial fuel cells fabricated using proton exchange membrane and earthen pot at different pH (2010) Bioelectrochemistry, 79, pp. 228-233; (2008) Comprehensive Industry Documents on Pulse, Wheat, Rice Mills.

A multirotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAVs, namely Trirotor aircraft is investigated. In essence the the trirotor model consists of three DC motors equipped with three fixed pitch angle rotors without the aid of a swashplate. The mathematical modelling of this multirotor is governed by the Newton-Euler formulation. A classical control algorithm viz. heuristic (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) PID tuning was adopted in the attitude and altitude control of this particular multirotor configuration. It was established from the Simulink simulations that, a PD controller was suffice to control the attitude whilst PID was apt for controlling the altitude of this form of multirotor. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","MATLAB/simulink; Proportional-integral-derivative (PID); Trirotor; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)","Classical control; MATLAB /simulink; Newton Euler formulation; PD controllers; Proportional integral derivatives; Simulink simulations; Trirotor; Vertical take-off and landings; Algorithms; Altitude control; DC motors; Industrial engineering; Landing; Proportional control systems; Takeoff; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",,,,,,,,,"McCall, G., Corder, J., (1996) New World Vistas: Air and Space Power For the 21 St Century; Castillo, P., Lozano, R., Dzul, R., Stabilization of a mini rotorcraft with four rotors (2005) Control Systems, IEEE, 25, pp. 45-55; Derafa, L., Ouldali, A., Madani, T., Benallegue, A., (2007) Four Rotors Helicopter Yaw and Altitude Stabilization, p. 1; Salih, A.L., Moghavvemi, M., Mohamed, H.A., Gaeid, K.S., Flight PID controller design for a UAV quadrotor (2010) Scientific Research and Essays, 5, pp. 3660-3667; Guenard, N., Hamel, T., Moreau, V., Dynamic modeling and intuitive control strategy for an X4- flyer, Control and Automation (2005) International Conference On. 1, 1, pp. 141-146. , 2005.

We design and formally prove security of two access control schemes, with distinct security and performance guarantees: one based on authenticated Bloom filters, and one based on either long or short (e.g. 16-bits long) aggregated MAC codes. The use of the short codes, while providing a clear performance benefit, cannot be proven secure by a simple reduction to existing aggregated MAC tools, and required careful handling and a concrete security analysis. The advantage of our schemes is that they are both simple yet much more efficient than the naive MAC-based access control. Our solution requires explicit designation of each record-attribute-user tuple as permitted or disallowed. We rely on shared secret key cryptography, and our system can scale even for use by large organizations. We implemented and deployed our algorithms in an industrial system setup. Our tests mimic usage scenarios of medium-size DB (10M records) of telephone company call records. Our experiments show that we achieve high (scalable) efficiency both in the server and checker computation, as well as extremely low communication overhead. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Aggregate MAC; Bloom filter; Implementation; Provably secure access control","Access control; Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Data structures; Large scale systems; Access control lists; Access control schemes; Bloom filters; Communication overheads; Implementation; Performance benefits; Provably secure; Security and performance; Network security",,,,,,,,,"Bauer, L., Garriss, S., Reiter, M.K., Detecting and resolving policy misconfigurations in access-control systems (2008) SACMAT, pp. 185-194; Becker, M.Y., Fournet, C., Gordon, A.D., Secpal: Design and semantics of a decentralized authorization language (2010) Journal of Computer Security, 18 (4), pp. 619-665; Bellare, M., Goldreich, O., Mityagin, A., (2004) The Power of Verification Queries in Message Authentication and Authenticated Encryption, , http://eprint.iacr.org/, Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2004/309; Blaze, M., Feigenbaum, J., Keromytis, A.D., KeyNote: Trust management for public-key infrastructures (1999) Security Protocols 1998.

As a result of the Android security flaws, attackers can easily collect private information of users, and the information can be utilized in APT attacks. It is not only a threat to the end user, but also poses a threat to industrial control systems and mobile Internet. In this paper, we propose a network traffic monitoring system used in the detection of Android malware. The system consists of four components: traffic monitoring, traffic anomaly recognition, response processing and cloud storage. The system parses the protocol of data packets and extracts the feature data, then use SVM classification algorithm for data classification, determine whether the network traffic is abnormal, and locate the application that produced abnormal through the correlation analysis. The system not only can automatic response and process the malicious software, but also can generate new security policy from existing information and training data; When training data is reaching a certain amount, it will trigger a new round of training to improve the ability of detection. Finally, we experiment on the system, the experimental results show that our system can effectively detect the Android malware and control the application. © 2014 IEEE.","Android; Malware; Network traffic monitoring; SVM","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data mining; Digital storage; Industrial electronics; Malware; Android; Correlation analysis; Data classification; Industrial control systems; Malicious software; Network traffic monitoring; Private information; SVM; Android (operating system)",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Tencent Mobile Security Lab Mobile Security Report, , http://m.qq.com/security_lab/news_detail_194.html, (month day).

Most of the existing SCADA networks have fortified securities because of their powerful access control based on closed and private networks. However, recent SCADA networks are frequently connected to various IT-based systems and also to other conventional networks, in order to achieve the operational convenience of SCADA systems, as well as the execution requirements of various applications. Therefore, SCADA systems have acute needs for secure countermeasures against the ordinary network vulnerabilities and for tangible preparations against ever-changing intrusion attacks such as advanced persistent threat (APT). This paper introduces the concept of m-connected SCADA networks, analyzes various security vulnerabilities on such networks, and finally proposes an integrated secure model having an APT managing module and a rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for internal and external network access. © 2014 Si-Jung Kim et al.",,"Sensor networks; External network; Industrial infrastructure; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network vulnerability; Private networks; Secure modeling; Security vulnerabilities; Supervisory control and data acquisition; SCADA systems",,,,,,,,,"Kim, W., Kim, H.K., Lee, K., Youm, H.Y., Risk analysis and monitoring model of urban SCADA network infrastructure (2011) Journal of the Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptology, 21 (6), pp. 67-81; Stouffer, K., Falco, J., Scarfone, K., (2008) Guide to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Industrial Control Systems Security, , NIST Special Publication 800-82; Kim, S.-J., Kim, B.-H., Yeo, S.-S., Cho, D.-E., Network anomaly detection for m-connected SCADA networks Proceedings of International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA '13), pp. 351-354. , October 2013; Robles, R.J., Choi, M.-K., Assessment of the vulnerabilities of SCADA,control systems and critical infrastructure systems (2009) International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing, 2 (2), pp. 27-34; Cheung, S., Dutertre, B., Fong, M., Lindqvist, U., Skinner, K., Valdes, A., Using model-based intrusion detection for SCADA network Proceedings of the SCADA Security Scientific Symposium January 2007, pp. 127-134; Verba, J., Milvich, M., Idaho national laboratory supervisory control and data acquisition intrusion detection system (SCADA IDS) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST '08), pp. 469-473. , May 2008 2-s2.0-50649107305 10.1109/THS.2008.4534498; Oman, P., Phillips, M., Goetz, E., Shenoi, S., Intrusion detection and event monitoring in SCADA networks (2007) Critical Infrastructure Protection, 253, pp. 161-173. , Springer IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 10.1007/978-0-387-75462-8-12; Holbert, K.E., Mishra, A., Mill, L., Intrusion detection through SCADA systems using fuzzy logic-based state estimation methods (2007) International Journal of Critical Infrastructures, 3 (1-2), pp. 58-87. , DOI 10.1504/IJCIS.2007.011545; Choi, D., Lee, S., Won, D., Kim, S., Efficient secure group communications for SCADA (2010) IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 25 (2), pp. 714-722. , 2-s2.0-77950187346 10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2036181; Kwon, J.O., Hong, Y.J., A study on the security management plan of industrial control system (2011) Samsung SDS Journal of IT Services, 8 (2), pp. 112-135; Carcano, A., Fovino, I.N., Masera, M., Trombetta, A., Rome, E., Bloomfield, R., State-based network intrusion detection systems for SCADA protocols: A proof of concept (2010) Critical Information Infrastructures Security, 6027, pp. 138-150. , Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science 10.1007/978-3-642-14379-3-12; Data and communication security - Profiles including MMS (2007) IEC Standard, , International Electro Technical Commission IEC 62351-4; Data and communication security - Security for IEC 61850 (2007) IEC Standard, , International Electro Technical Commission IEC 62351-6; Jyothsna, V., Prasad, V.V.R., Prasad, K.M., A review of anomaly based intrusion detection systems (2011) International Journal of Computer Applications, 28 (7), pp. 26-35; Kang, D.-J., Lee, J.-J., Lee, Y., Lee, I.-S., Kim, H.-K., Quantitative methodology to assess cyber security risks of SCADA system in electric power industry (2013) Journal of Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptology, 23 (3), pp. 445-457. , 10.13089/JKIISC.2013.23.3.445; Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, , http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-30-rev1/SP800-30-Rev1-ipd. pdf, 2012; (2012) Blue Code Security Report; APT Attack; (2012) Understanding of Next-Generation Security Evasion Techniques APT; (2012) The Start of the Next-Generation Hacking, Malicious Code and Understanding How to Respond; (2008) Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security","Yeo, S.-S.; Division of Convergence Computer and Media, Mokwon University, Daejeon 302-729, South Korea; email: sangsooyeo@gmail.com",,,"Hindawi Publishing Corporation",,,,,15501329,,,,"English","Int.

It is a very difficult problem to be solved, and affects the applications of vortex flowmeter. To solve this key problem, the frequency features of the flow signal and vibration noise are analyzed. A frequency-variance algorithm is proposed to deal with the vortex flow sensor output signal. A variance threshold is set to distinguish the vortex flow signal from the vibration noise interference. A signal processing system based on an ultralow-power microcontroller is developed to implement the algorithm and to extract the flow rate information from the signal containing strong vibration noise. At the same time, this system meets the requirements of low-power and two-wire mode, and can be used in process control. The strong vibration experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of both antistrong vibration algorithm and the system. Only one vortex flow sensor is required in the vortex flowmeter, which avoids the design and installation of the vibration sensor and saves the costs of meter. © 2013 IEEE.","Frequency-variance algorithm; Strong vibration interference; Ultralow-power microcontroller; Vortex flowmeter","Algorithms; Flow measurement; Flowmeters; Industrial applications; Sensors; Signal processing; Frequency features; In-process control; Interference methods; Signal processing systems; Ultra-low power; Vibration experiment; Vortex flow sensor; Vortex flowmeters; Vortex flow",,,,,"61074164",,,,"Pankanin, G.L., Berlinski, J., Chmielewski, R., Analytical modeling of Karman vortex street (2005) Metrol.

Filtration application requires a uniform lay of yarn or its performance may be affected, hence, for the aforesaid purpose, the precision system would be more apt. Recent trends show an increased use of electronics in all applications, textiles being no exception. The aim of the present work was to develop a filter cartridge winder (laboratory model) based on the precision winding system, controlled electronically. The novelty of this machine lies in the fact that it makes use of a chain to reciprocate the guide mounted on it, unlike the majority of commercial filter winders, which make use of scroll cams to traverse the yarn. Filter winders are specialized winders that produce cartridges in standard sizes of 10"", 20"", 30"" and up to 70"". Thus a cartridge winder is quite different from the usual winding machines not only in terms of its traverse length and feed material but also because of the core tube which has to be perforated just as one required for a dyeing process.","Electronic control; Gain; Gear factor; Precision winding; Pressure drop; Traverse; Wind ratio","Control; Industrial electronics; Pressure drop; Servomechanisms; Winding machines; Wool; Yarn; Dyeing process; Electronic controls; Feed materials; Filter cartridge; Gain; Laboratory models; Traverse; Winding system; Projectiles",,,,,,,,,"http://www.bematex-new.com/en/macchinario-ca.html; Google images; SSM winding machine Broucher; Booth, J.E., (1977) Textile Mathematics, 3. , The Textile Institute; Koranne, M.V., Vasavada, D.A., (1997) Winding Fundamentals, , April, Manmade Textiles in India; Trommer, G., Grünert, H., (1990) Influence of Fiber and Yarn Parameters On Yarn Package Filter Cartridges, , Dec, MELLIAND ENGLISH; (1998) Filters With Friction Spinning Flair!, , Technofront, Dec, Textile Industry of India","Sanjiv Kanade, P.; M.S.

As the multi-axis machine tools have a variety of configurations, their NC codes are not exchangeable. This issue leads to some inconvenience and confounding in the manufacturing processing schedule. Furthermore, when the specifications of tool such as length, diameter or shape are reset, the NC program must be regenerated accordingly. That is to say, the exchangeability of NC program among different five-axis machine configurations is an important issue in making better usage of industrial five-axis machine tools for efficient applications. An APT program records the tool path, tool vector and cutting information, etc. In particular, the recent development of APT format can provide the capability recording the motion posture of the tool such as the tool orientation, the position and its normal vector of the tool contact point. Therefore, it can solve the problems of the exchangeability for the different machine tools as well as the online resetting of tool specifications, even the tool posture. In this paper, a new method was proposed to interpret the APT code into tool movement data including toolpath, location, tool orientation, the contact point and its contact vector, etc., which can be applied to the conversion of different NC codes, or be connected to the controller of the machine tool so as to proceed the interpolation calculation for directly machining control. Moreover, the application scope can be extended to the verification of machining and to drive a virtual machine tool for previewing. Since the APT format varies according to different CAD/CAM systems, a common intermediate interchange standard (CMIS) was proposed, designed and verified in this paper as a feasible solution for the exchangeability of different APT formats. The process of the proposed method includes interpreting a variety of APT program into a common standard format, and then transforming this intermediate standard code into various NC programs for the corresponding machine configurations. An example was used to demonstrate how to convert an APT generated by CATIA software into intermediate code for a Table-Table five-axis machine tool with two rotary axes attached on table (XYZAC configuration). As the APT contains the definition of inclined plane, so the homogeneous coordinate transformation was adopted to transform the coordinate system of the inclined plane into the work coordinate system; it was further transformed into the corresponding NC program via an inverse kinematics transformation. This example has shown the feasibility of the method proposed. Moreover, the research can be applied not only to the exchangeability of different APT format but also to the other related applications such as the verification of machining error and the drive of virtual machine tool. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","APT program; CATIA APT; Five-axis machining; Post processor","5-axis machine tool; APT program; CAD/CAM system; CATIA APT; Co-ordinate system; Common standards; Contact points; Contact vectors; Feasible solution; Five-axis machine tools; Five-axis machines; Five-axis machining; Homogeneous coordinate transformations; Inclined planes; Interchange standard; Machining error; Movement datum; Multi-axis machine tool; NC code; NC Program; Normal vector; Post-processor; Processing schedule; Standard codes; Tool contact; Tool orientation; Tool posture; Toolpaths; Virtual machine tools; Computer simulation; Digital storage; End effectors; Innovation; Inverse kinematics; Machine tools; Program processors; Specifications; Application programs",,,,,,,,,"Schmidt, J., (1994) Controls for Complex Woodworking, Wood & Wood Products, 99 (12), pp. 130-131; Nagata, F., Watanabe, K., Development of Post-processor Module of 5-axis Control NC Machine Tool with Tilting-head for Woody Furniture (1996) Journal of the Japan Society for Precision Engineering, 62 (8), pp. 1203-1207; Bohme, D., Five-axis Laser Robots for Materials Processing (1989) The Industrial Robot, 16 (1), pp. 41-45; Connolly, G., Multiaxis Laser Cuts Manufacturing Time of Aerospace Parts (1994) Mechanical Engineering, pp. 64-65; Erkorkmaz, K., Alzaydi, A., Elfizy, A., Engin, S., Time-optimal trajectory generation for 5-axis on-the-fly laser drilling (2011) CIRP Annals-Manufacturing Technology, pp. 411-414; Suh, S.H., Seo, Y., Lee, S.M., Choi, T.H., Jeong, G.S., Kim, D.Y., Modelling and Implementation of Internet-based Virtual Machine Tools (2003) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 21, pp. 516-522; Ong, S.K., Jiang, L., Nee, A.Y.C., An Internet-based Virtual CNC Milling System (2002) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 20, pp. 20-30","Cheng, H.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, , Tainan City 74448, Taiwan; email: hycheng@cc.kuas.edu.tw",,"AandF;Tailift Co., Ltd;SPINTECH;Smart Motion Control Co.,Ltd.;FXB Flexible Motion;et al",,"2nd International Conference on Engineering and Technology Innovation 2012, ICETI 2012","2 November 2012 through 6 November 2012","Kaohsiung",95485,16609336,9783037856123,,,"English","Appl.

These layers have a variety of use-cases, such as optical bandpassing, dielectric permittivity, or lubrication. Mostly, these layers are in motion due to the production process. In order to observe process parameters, the motion usually has to be disrupted. Thus, the increase of production time due to control purposes is an undesirable drawback of this otherwise suitable technique. In this publication, we present a solution to this particular drawback of most production process monitoring systems exemplarily for film thickness measurement. We show the realization of a measurement principle which has, to our knowledge, never been published before in this application. Therefore, we exploit the advantages of the combination of a linear variable filter with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor array. By an apt readout sequence, this measurement system is able to measure transmission spectra while the target is in motion. We show that this measurement system is able to measure film thicknesses of objects in the range of several 100 nm thickness at up to a velocity of 4 m/s.

The synchronization specifications require a real time wireless communication protocol affordable, safe and with low latency, in order to ensure a minimum guaranteed throughput apt to synchronize the machine work and travel. The paper describes the characteristics of a quasi-isochronous Wireless transmission protocol based on IP/UDP under Linux Operating System and the protocol evolution with respect to what reported in previous work[1].

CFATS is risk based, which means that chemical site and transportation risks are evaluated based on the types of chemicals involved and their volumes. The chemical process industries (CPI) facilities are required to submit information about the chemicals and volumes they handle, and the sites are classified into four tiers based on a risk assessment. The Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) has also issued guidance for risk-based performance assessments of CFATS security plans.

In dynamic routing a calculated path particularly depends on the number of currently active AGVs' missions and their priorities. In order to solve the shortest path problem dynamically, the proposed routing method uses time windows in a vector form. For each mission requested by the supervisor, predefined candidate paths are checked if they are feasible. The feasibility of a particular path is evaluated by insertion of appropriate time windows and by performing the windows overlapping tests. The use of time windows makes the algorithm apt for other scheduling and routing problems. Presented simulation results demonstrate efficiency of the proposed dynamic routing. The proposed method has been successfully implemented in the industrial environment in a form of a multiple AGV control system. Note To Practitioners-The automated warehouses are the facilities which can be equipped with stationary and mobile robotic sections (e.g. palletization workcells and unmanned forklifts, respectively). The goals, such as the maximal production throughput, efficient utilization of all robotic subsystems and collision avoidance with accommodation to dynamic changes within the manufacturing process itself have been achieved by designing and implementing a supervisory controller whose main characteristics are the ability of dynamic routing and scheduling in accordance with the current status of a given shop floor layout. The maximal throughput is provided by applying a shortest path algorithm, while potential conflicts and deadlocks are resolved by using the time windows insertion and time windows overlapping check algorithms. Because of the safety reasons, the proposed supervisory controller is somewhat restrictive, allowing only one vehicle to reside at one arc at the time. The described multi-AGV control system was successfully installed and put in operation at several European factories. © 2009 IEEE.","Automated guided vehicles; Dynamic routing; Path feasibility; Time windows","AGV system; Automated guided vehicles; Automated warehouse; Current status; Dynamic changes; Dynamic routing; Dynamic routing methods; Industrial environments; Main characteristics; Manufacturing process; Maximal throughput; Mobile robotic; Potential conflict; Routing methods; Scheduling and routing; Shop floor; Shortest path algorithms; Shortest path problem; Simulation result; Supervisory control; Supervisory controllers; Time windows; Unmanned forklift; Controllers; Robotics; Throughput; Vehicles; Warehouses; Windows",,,,,,"Manuscript received February 15, 2008; revised September 24, 2008.

Each new connection to the internet adds a new participant to the medium, who is not only capable of freely receiving information, but also to disseminate it in a manner which is as amateurish or as professional as the individual's capabilities and desires permit. In effect, the internet has given all of us the power to broadcast information in a manner and on a scale that has never before been witnessed, and our society is confronted with the consequences of this evolution on a daily basis. We have the capability to publish any information we see fit on the worldwide web without any prior control, to make free phone calls, to send files of any kind to destinations known or unknown across the globe, or to impose hundreds of thousands of e? mails per day on willing or unwilling recipients, asking for their money, their passwords, or simply their attention. While each country is free in principle to attempt to create its own set of rules to apply to any or all of the aforementioned phenomena, to a large extent these activities have thus far escaped effective and suitable regulation. Even when international initiatives2 attempt to bridge the cross'border pitfall that is so very inherent in the information society, such initiatives have inevitably failed to assume control over their subject matter, either because of an inability to define an appropriate rule set, a lack of consensus regarding the goals to be achieved, or the Gordian knot of international private law. In the information age, forum shopping and rule evasion has never been easier or more effective for those with time, resources, and above all, knowledge to spare. However, this lack of effective and enforceable legislation and the resulting ?free?for?all? mentality has not been all bad. One might in fact argue with some merit that this basic characteristic has fostered a sense of new entrepreneurship that has been a vital factor for growth for the information society. The old adage ?Knowledge is Power? seems to have proven its worth as a basic truism and as a building block of modern societies worldwide, with the perceived value of information growing day by day. As the supposed reflection of societies' needs and values, evolutions in the law mirror this trend: record numbers of patent applications are filed and granted each year; incumbents struggle to make sure that their copyrights are protected as thoroughly as possible, and society as a whole has increasingly become aware of the value of its personal data. This evolution has resulted in ever more extensive and complicated legislation, and regulation in all shapes and sizes. The list of measures which have been taken to ensure the protection of the value of information is as staggering as it is telling. In the information society, intangible assets are regarded as the most valuable component of almost any modern company, and people are only considered to exist if they can present the data to prove it. Information is invaluable, and the law strives to ensure that no value can drain from the system. After all, a society can ill afford to gamble with its basic building blocks. While the increasing regulatory focus on information control is certainly radical and far?reaching, Western societies have undergone a much more fundamental socio?cultural paradigm shift in their treatment of information in the last centuries, and even more so in the last few decades. In pre?industrial societies, the cost and effort involved in merely (re)creating physical information carriers could be quite significant, rivalling the cost of collection and processing of information itself. After all, while writing a book may take many months in itself, the need (or desire) to have such a book hand? reproduced through meticulous labour in monastery manufactures effectively meant that easy dissemination of data was out of the question. Gutenberg's invention of the printing press around 1448 and the gradual improvement of the printing process altered this equation somewhat. As the cost of information reproduction fell to a value that was insignificant compared to investment related to the creation process, an economic need was born to provide creators with an incentive to continue to produce new works, despite the risk of parasitical competition from printing houses with the technical means to profit from another person's creativity. And hence, around the beginnings of the 18th century3 copyright was created as a (partial) solution to the shortcomings of the systems of patronage that preceded it. However, the increasing ease with which information could be disseminated gave rise to concerns of principle in addition to the mainly4 economic origins of copyright. It is no coincidence that the same period which gave rise to copyright regulation also saw the birth of the first structured legal debates concerning privacy. While a certain desire to be left alone seems to be innate to the human condition and prevalent in most societies, the debate regarding the right to be left alone seems to have its origins in the late 19th century, being remarked on for the first time in a legal context in the US in an 1879 publication by Thomas Cooley. Where early legal systems mainly limited their information regulations to the protection of personal reputation through claims such as libel, slander, and defamation, the increasing importance that was attached to information resulted in a gradual extension of this framework to include issues such as intellectual property, data protection, free speech regulations, broadcast licensing, and to what can broadly be referred to as telecommunications law. The rapid development of communications technology, the birth of mass media, of entertainment industries, and the increasing prevalence and importance of information channels resulted in the birth of a new paradigm: the fundamental conviction that information is vitally important to the economic development of societies and to the personal well?being of individuals, and thus that data ownership is a key economic issue. Information has a value which is quantifiable (either positively5 or negatively6) and can be monetised. As a result, since the beginning of the post?industrial age and the birth of mass media society, the possession, control, and use of information have gradually become the pillars of Western information regulation. This is an apt solution model in a society where public communication is governed by a number of basic principles, most notably: ? The principle that the power of communication is essentially tiered, in the sense that there are a small number of mass media information broadcasters who produce and distribute information, and a large number of information consumers whose production and distribution capabilities are much more limited, either technically, geographically, or economically. This distinction is important, as it allows a society to control the vast majority of influential information exchanges by focusing on the smaller number of broadcasters, rather than on the larger number of consumers. ? The principle that it is possible to regulate information flows, that a sufficient consensus can be established in a democratic society regarding the scope and application of such a regulatory framework, specifically taking into account socio?cultural sensitivities, dominant economical paradigms, and the basic human right of free speech. ? The principle that both data disseminators and consumers can be identified in case of breach of information regulation. Without the possibility of identifying the participants in a data exchange, enforcement of information regulation by the public authorities becomes impossible, and the rules lose much of their value. In the author's opinion, all three of the aforementioned principles have become threatened through the aforementioned technological evolutions. Furthermore, it seems unlikely at this point that this evolution could be reversed, even if this would be found to be desirable. Finally, it is not inconceivable that the continuance of this evolution could strongly impact the validity of the Western information regulation model. As indicated previously, the internet has upset the first principle mentioned above with regard to tiered communication structures. The division between information broadcasters and information consumers is fading, since the entry barrier to joining the information broadcasting market has become quite low. It does not take a great deal of money, effort, or know?how to make one's voice be heard across the globe. The phenomenon of blogging7 is an interesting example8: while the ability to create a personal news site is anything but new, the availability of widely accessible blogging service providers allows even the most technically inept to gain a forum to spread their personal opinions, however incorrect or insignificant they may be, to a worldwide audience. While most blogs are unable to actually attract a substantial fan base, others have risen in prominence to the ranks of pseudo?news agencies in their own right. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention, , http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm, Typical Examples Include E.g; UNCITRAL E-Commerce Initiatives, , www.uncitral.org/; Other Interesting Examples Include Certain Popular Social Networking Sites, including MySpace, , www.myspace.com; Facebook, , www.facebook.com; YouTube, , www.youtube.com; www.thinksecret.com/, last visited on 28 August 2006; Court of Appeal California, Sixth Appellate District, , http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/27BStroke6/AppleRuling.pdf, 26 May 2006; (2000) TGI Paris, , http://www.eff.org/legal/Jurisdiction_and_sovereignty/LICRA_v_Yahoo/ 20001120_fr_int_ruling.en.pdf, 20 November, see; It Should Be Noted That the Matter Was Subsequently Presented before US Courts, with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Deciding on, , www.eff.org/legal/Jurisdiction_and_sovereignty/LICRA_v_Yahoo/ 20040823_yahoo_v_licra-9th.pdf, 23 August 2004 to largely uphold the decision; US District Court for the Northern District of California Had First Refused to Uphold It Due to Conflict with US Free Speech Principles, , http://www.eff.org/legal/Jurisdiction_and_sovereignty/LICRA_v_Yahoo/ 20011107_us_distct_decision.pdf; Biddle, P., England, P., Peinado, M., Willman, B., (2001) The Darknet and the Future of Content Distribution, , http://msl1.mit.edu/ESD10/docs/darknet5.pdf#search= %22The%20Darknet%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20Content%20Distribution%22, (last visited on 28 August 2006); The Example Is A So-called Content Hash Key (CHK) of the Type Used by the Freenet Project, Copied in A Slightly Modified Version from, , http://www.freenethelp.org, the website; http://freenetproject.org/, last visited on 24 August 2006; http://entropy.stop1984.com/en/home.html, last visited on 24 August 2006; http://antsp2p.sourceforge.net/, last visited on 24 August 2006; http://www.i2p.net/, last visited on 24 August 2006; http://tor.eff.org/, last visited on 24 August 2006; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasttrack; http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/; http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm; http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm; Inter Alia, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCP-Auroraforanaccountofthisincident, last visited on 28 August 2007; www.wikipedia.org; The Recent Commercial Success of the Arctic Monkeys, A UK-based Rock Band Who Credit A Large Part of Their Success to Their On-line Presence on the MySpace Social Networking Site, , www.myspace.com; The Comment Was Posted as A Comment under the Pseudonym 'Precision Blogger' on the Following Page, , http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050518/1455210_F.shtml; The Poster's Own Website Can Be Found, , http://precision-blogging.blogspot.com, where the poster's claimed identity can be uncovered","Graux, H.; Catholic University of LeuvenBelgium",,,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,,,,,9783540798552,,,"English","Facing the Limits of the Law",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892195973

The multivariable four-tank system has attracted recent attention, as it illustrates many concepts in multivariable control, particularly interaction, transmission zero, and non-minimum phase characteristics that emerge from a simple cascade of tanks. So, the multivariable laboratory process of four interconnected water tanks is considered for modeling and control. For processes which show nonlinear and multivariable characteristics, classical control strategies like PIDs have performance limitations. Hence, intelligent approaches like Neural Networks (NN) is an important term in this juncture. The use of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is apt for modeling and control of nonlinear dynamic processes as it contains the past information about the process. The objective of the current study is to design and implement an adaptive control system using RNN for a nonlinear multivariable process. The proposed adaptive design comprises an estimator based on RNN, which adapts online and predicts one step ahead output. A Recursive Least Square (RLS) based back propagation algorithm is used for training the network. The controller used is also a RNN, which minimizes the difference between the predicted output and reference trajectory. The objective function is minimized using a steepest descent algorithm which gives the optimum control input. Desired performance of the system is ensured by the parallel operation of both. The proposed control strategy is implemented in a laboratory scale four tank system. The trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection response obtained are compared with the response obtained by using a well designed decoupled, decentralized IMC controller.","Adaptive control; Decentralized IMC controller; Quadruple tank process; Recurrent neural network","Adaptive control; Adaptive designs; Classical control; Complex dynamics; Control strategies; Decentralized IMC controller; Industrial processs; Laboratory process; Laboratory scale; Modeling and control; Multi variables; Multivariable control; Multivariable process; Non-linear dynamics; Non-minimum phase; Nonlinear behavior; Objective functions; One step; Optimum control; Parallel operations; Performance limitations; Quadruple tank process; Recursive least squares; Reference trajectories; Steepest descent algorithm; Tank system; Trajectory tracking; Transmission zeros; Adaptive control systems; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation algorithms; Controllers; Disturbance rejection; Multivariable systems; Recurrent neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Semiconducting intermetallics; Water tanks; Process control",,,,,,,,,"Ham, F.M., Kostanic, I., (2001) Principles of Neurocomputing for Science and Engineering, , McGraw Hill; Astrom, J., Wittenmark, B., (1995) Adaptive Control, , Adisson Wiley Publishing Company; Narendra, K.S., Parthasarathy, K., Identification and control of dynamical systems using neural networks (1990) IEEE Trans.

These platforms come prepared for the control and postprocessing of up to a maximum of 5-axis trajectories (i.e., three positioning coordinates and two orientation angles of the milling tool), which supposes no indecisions in conventional CNC machines. In the case of manipulating the milling tool by means of redundant workcells, a profuse kinematic analysis of the robotic system is required before any work is carried out. In this article, the inverse kinematics of a complex KUKA robotic system for milling works is described, consisting of one robotic manipulator (KUKA KR15/2 with 6 rotary joints) mounted on a linear axis and synchronized with a rotary table. Thus, the possible effective control to carry out trough the commercial controller KUKA KRC2 is also faced up, in order to analyze the postprocessing possibilities from NXTM's CAM platform. As main contribution, after studying the capabilities of the set, a functional postprocessor is programmed inside the CAM, improving the communication between software and manipulator.

In the present assessment, impending dissonances between the nominal industrial utility of Web 2.0-tools and their human use-related promises are explicated and ordered into four conflict-categories: utility, design and innovation, deployment and control, and outcome expectation. Rooted in this evaluation, concrete arguments in favor and critical of Enterprise Web 2.0-deployment are outlined and then translated into a set of managerial suggestions. Throughout, the review is guided by a distinct socio-psychologically-based adaption-perspective on technology deployment, intended to complement the predominant implementation (technology roll-out) viewpoint.",,"Business development; Critical review; Design and innovations; Effective management; Enterprise webs; Technology deployment; Web 2.0; Industry; Information systems; Profitability; World Wide Web; Technology",,,,,,,,,"Lamont, J., Blogs and wikis: Ready for prime time?

This concept, termed the 3D Path Concept, is a key near-term step that enables trajectory-based operations in a voice communications environment. When applied to arrival management, the ground-based automation system computes an optimal arrival schedule at the meter fixes and runways and selects trajectories that meet the schedule and ensure separation. These 4D trajectories are cleared prior to top of descent (TOD) and provide necessary delay in the form of cruise and descent speed changes, combined with lateral path adjustments when needed. The trajectories are flown by the aircraft's FMS with accurate navigation performance and optimized vertical profiles, which is generally not feasible today due to the use of open-ended vectors. The analysis of the performance of this arrival management concept using the Boeing Trajectory Analysis and Modeling Environment (TAME) is presented in this paper. TAME uses the Eurocontrol Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) to represent aircraft performance for the fast-time simulation. The 3D Path Concept is applied to operations in the Houston airport area, and arrivals into Houston Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) are modeled using TAME. The results illustrate the influence of path and speed discretization, wind, trajectory prediction and navigation performance. Additionally, results showing the overall performance of the IAH arrival flow using 4 and 6 arrival meter fixes are presented, showing the increased airport throughput that can be achieved when airspace constraints are removed.",,"4 D Trajectory (4DT); Air traffic management (ATM); Aircraft data; Aircraft performance; Airport Throughput (APT); Automation systems; Automation tools; Descent speed; Digital avionics; Discretization; Eurocontrol (CO); Fast-time simulation; Flight management systems (FMS); Ground-based; Houston; Navigation performance; Overall performance; Performance analyses; Top of descent (TOD); Trajectory analysis; Trajectory prediction; Vertical profiling; Voice communications; Air navigation; Aircraft; Aircraft instruments; Airports; Avionics; Digital arithmetic; Flexible manufacturing systems; Industrial engineering; Management; Metric system; Separation; Speech communication; Speed; Trajectories; Air traffic control",,,,,,,,,"Erzberger, H., Design Principles and Algorithms for Automated Air Traffic Management (1995) AGARD Lecture Series, 200. , Knowledge-Based Functions in Aerospace Systems; Coppenbarger, R., Lanier, R., Sweet, D., Dorsky, S., Design and Development of the En Route Descent Advisor (EDA) for Conflict-Free Arrival Metering (2004) Proceedings of the AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference; Volckers, U., Computer Assisted Sequencing and Scheduling with the COMPAS System (1986) AGARD-CP-410, 42nd symposium of the Guidance and Control Panel, , Brussels, Belgium; Maestro Sequencing System for Arrival and Departure Flights, , www.sofreavia.com/uk/products/maestro/maestro.htm; Avibit Data Processing, , www.avibit.com/Solutions/OPTAMOS.htm; Kirk, D.B., Heagy, W.S., Yablonski, M.J., Problem Resolution Support for Free Flight Operations (2001) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2 (2). , June; Meckiff, C., Chone, R., Nicolaon, J.-P., The Tactical Load Smoother for Multi-Sector Planning (1998) 2nd USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar, , Orlando, Florida; Haraldsdottir, A., Berge, M.E., Kang, L., Schoemig, E.G., Alcabin, M.S., Repetto, B., Carter, M.L., Required Navigation Performance and 3D Paths in High-Traffic ATM Operations (2006) 25th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, , Portland, Oregon; Haraldsdottir, A., Scharl, J., Berge, M.E., Schoemig, E., Coats, M.L., Arrival Management with Required Navigation Performance and 3D Paths (2007) 4th USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar, , Barcelona, Spain; Schoemig, E.G., Armbruster, J., Boyle, D.A., Haraldsdottir, A., 3D Path Concept and Flight Management System (FMS) Trades (2006) 25th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, , Portland, Oregon; Williams, D.H., Green, S.M., (1998) Flight Evaluation of Center-TRACON Automation System Trajectory Prediction Process, , NASA Technical Paper, NASA/TP-1998-208439; Coppenbarger, R.A., Lanier, R., Sweet, D., Dorsky, S., Design and Development of the En Route Descent Advisor (EDA) for Conflict-Free Arrival Metering (2004) AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference and Exhibit, , Providence, Rhode Island; (2006) Order 7110.65R, Air Traffic Control, , US Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, DC, May; Scharl, J., Haraldsdottir, A., Schoemig, E.G., A Trajectory Modeling Environment for the Study of Arrival Traffic Delivery Accuracy (2006) AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technologies Conference, , Colorado; www.oag.com, OAG Worldwide Limited; Berge, M.E., Haraldsdottir, A., Scharl, J., The Multiple Runway Planner (MRP): Modeling and Analysis for Arrival Planning (2006) 25th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, , Portland, Oregon; Scharl, J., Berge, M.E., Coats, M.L., Haraldsdottir, A., Schoemig, E.G., Modeling and Analysis of the 3D Path Arrival Management Concept (2007) AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technologies Conference, , Hilton Head, South Carolina; Green, S.M., Grace, M.P., Williams, D.H., Flight Test Results: CTAS and FMS Cruise/Descent Trajectory Prediction Accuracy (2000) 3rd USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar, , Naples, Italy; Scharl, J., Berge, M.E., Haraldsdottir, A., Schoemig, E.G., A Near-Term Arrival Management Operational Concept and Preliminary Considerations (2006) 25th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, , Portland, Oregon; (1995) Airmen's Informational Manual, , US Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington DC","Haraldsdottir, A.; Boeing Company, Seattle, WA, United States",,"BOEING;OBJECTIVE INTERFACE;MITRE",,"26th DASC Digital Avionics Systems Conference - 4-Dimensional Trajectory-Based Operaions: Impact on Future Avionics and Systems","21 October 2007 through 25 October 2007","Dallas, TX",72533,,1424411084; 9781424411085,ADACF,,"English","AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349145209

In dynamic routing a calculated path particularly depends on the number of currently active LGVs' missions and their priorities. In order to solve the shortest path problem dynamically, the proposed routing method uses the string matrix composition and time windows in a vector form. For each mission requested by the supervisor, the string composition algorithm first finds the candidate paths and then checks if they are feasible. The feasibility of a particular path is evaluated by insertion of appropriate time windows and by performing the windows overlapping tests. The algorithm resolves the time windows conflicts iteratively by inserting new time windows until the conflicts disappear or remain present only on the path's origin arc, which means that the found candidate paths are not feasible. The use of time windows makes the algorithm apt for other scheduling and routing problems.

The material considered is steel employed for high-speed train wheels. In order to generate strain states close to those expected in severe service conditions due to wheel-rail rolling-sliding contact, out-of-phase tension-torsion unsymmetric cycles are applied in laboratory tests. The experiments are simulated by conventional finite elements and Chaboche model with nonlinear kinematic hardening. The material parameters are identified through a deterministic, batch (non-sequential) inverse analysis in two stages (genetic and first-order algorithms) in view of the peculiar constraints in the minimization problem. This study leads to the following conclusions of practical use: multiaxial ratchetting tests are desirable to characterize cyclic material behavior in the industrial context considered; compact (instead of thin-walled tubular) specimen tests, combined with parameter identification by inverse analysis, exhibit the advantages of cost effectiveness and of small size needed to assess material properties locally. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This provides a privileged window of opportunity for the application of simulation tools and hence simulation is increasingly being used for the design of exhaust after-treatment systems with a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). DPF behavior depends strongly on the coupling of physico-chemical phenomena occurring over widely disparate spatial and temporal scales and a state-of-the-art simulation approach recognizes and exploits these facts introducing certain assumptions and/or simplifications to derive an accurate but computationally tractable DPF simulation tool, for the needs of industrial users. The present paper summarizes the current state of progress in DPF simulation, from the Aerosol & Particle Technology (APT) Laboratory, addressing consistent and rigorous refinements in a number of areas including: the aerodynamics at the filter and channel inlet, flow, filtration and reaction phenomena at the DPF material microstructure scale, and in coupling/interfacing DPF simulation with general purpose 3-D CFD codes. Where appropriate, experimental results are cited to re-enforce/validate the points brought forward by the theory.

Especially, Web service is chosen to compose business process by companies to achieve their business objectives. Business process contains a set of activities, which represent business interactions between Web services spanning company boundaries. As Web services are built in open distributed environment, it is apt to cause security concerns. Security problems mainly prevent many companies from implementing Web services. This paper proposes an extended RBAC model, called WS-RBAC4BP, to protect web services in business process. In this model, companies and Web services are considered as subjects and protected objects, respectively. New types of constraints are introduced. Furthermore, the system architecture of WS-RABC4BP is presented.

Both the pumps and the valve are driven by stepper motors with photoswitch position detection. By movement coordination of the pumps and the valve, no separate waiting time is necessary for the syringe to be refilled or discharged, and the leakage problem of the valve is also alleviated. The analyzer can be operated in two modes, flow-injection-analysis mode, into which most current FIA methods developed with peristaltic pumps can be easily adapted, and microtitration mode, with which major components in a sample can be titrated quickly, accurately, and in a microchemical way. To demonstrate, the analyzer was employed both for the determination of trace amounts of tungsten in the raffinate of ammonium paratungstate (APT) processing with FIA mode and for the determination of caustic hydroxide in the industrial production of aluminum oxide with microtitration mode.

However, it is generally recognized that appropriate nonlinear control laws are apt to give the best performance for strongly nonlinear systems such as pH systems. In recent years several powerful nonlinear control methods have become available. In this article we apply these methods for pH control in a simulated continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and show that remarkable improvements can be achieved in comparison with conventional PID-type control. It also will be shown that the techniques are simple and straightforward to develop and apply, and thus operator acceptance is likely to be high. Although pH control is the specific process of interest in this article, these methods can be applied to a large number of other nonlinear single input single output systems. These methods are likely to have a far-reaching impact on automatic control of industrial nonlinear processes.",,"Chemical Variables Control; Linearization; Mathematical Models; Nonlinear Control Systems; Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors; Global Linearization; Internal Model Control; PH Control; Process Control",,,,,,,,,,"Gokhale, N.D.; Univ of Louisville, Louisville, United States",,,,,,,,00188190,,HYPRA,,"English","Hydrocarbon Process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026134677

The concepts of ""parts family manufacture"" and ""group technology"" are compared. With NC-machinery already conceived for satisfying workpiece versatility requirements it is argued that a pre-sorting of workpieces into parts families may indeed be useful in NC-manufacturing, that however a finely-structured classification is in this case less sensible and apt than with conventional manufacturing. For NC-manufacturing, on the otherhand, workpiece shape elements or ""macros"", and especially the provision of standardized clamping possibilities on the workplace, take priority. The use of EDP, and compatibility with respect to workpiece transport and storage, especially in cell manufacture, must also be considered in order to achieve a balance between NC flexibility and unnecessarily detailed and expensive parts classification schemes. © 1983 CIRP.",,"COUNTRY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT; GROUP TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION; MACHINE TOOL AGE; MACHINE TOOL SOPHISTICATION; TOOL FLEXIBILITY; WORKFORCE EDUCATIONAL STANDARD; CONTROL SYSTEMS, NUMERICAL",,,,,,,,,"Scholz W. and Arndt G.: Component Handling in New Zealand Manufacturing Industry.

Especially when using industrial robots in flexible manufacturing cells for medium and small batch production the frequent reprogramming of robots on-line, e. g. TEACH-IN, could increase the idle-time of the whole system to an unacceptable amount. Here, the extensive off-line programming of industrial robots in the process planning department, as it is done with NC-machine tools, would be an adequate solution. For these purposes the programming system ROBEX has been designed. Its structure resembles the well-known APT- EXAPT System, thus it is independent of the type of robot and the type of computer.

Management of aquatic ecosystems requires a clear understanding of the goals to be achieved, appropriate information and the means to achieve the goals. Control measures applied to aquatic ecosystems, in the absence of information on the condition of the system, are apt to be inappropriate and thus may overprotect the receiving system at times and underprotect it at other times since the ability of ecosystems to receive wastes is not constant. A major determinant of the effectiveness and efficiency of ecological quality control is the lag time in the feedback of information. If the lag is too great, the control measures may repeatedly overshoot or undershoot the desired goal. Present techniques for measuring the responses of aquatic organisms and communities require days or weeks, whereas information for ecosystem quality control and prevention of ecological crises should be generated in minutes or hours as is the case for other quality control systems. Two biological monitoring systems have been developed to generate information rapidly. One system measures changes in the movement and breathing of fish in order to provide an early warning of developing toxicity in the wastes of an industrial plant. The other system measures changes in the diversity of algal comunities in streams by means of laser holography. The incorporation and use of these systems in industrial plants is discussed.

Its absorption rate from the gastrointestinal tract is only about 0.003 per cent. A small amount may be absorbed through the intact skin and through contaminated cuts and puncture wounds. Absorption from the lung may be from 1 to 10 per cent of the inhaled dose, depending on particle size, solubility, chemical form, etc. Inhalation of contaminated air is potentially the most important mode of exposure, and its control is largely responsible for the rigorous closed-systems and other industrial hygiene and engineering practices employed in plutonium processing. Once in the body, Pu239 is excreted extremely slowly (about 200 years being required to eliminate one-half the body burden). An individual who has reached the maximum permissible body burden technically should be removed from further plutonium contact for the rest of his life. The maximum permissible body burden of Pu239 (0.04 µc) is established by comparison with Ra226 and is that amount which has the same improbability of producing harm to any person at any time during his natural life as does 0.1 µc of fixed Ra226. Control of the industrial hazards of Pu239 processing is based on the premise that exposure of personnel should be as nearly zero as possible. This is not because less than the maximum permissible body burden is apt to do harm, but -because it is sound industrial medical and economic practice. If presently recommended practices are maintained, there is little reason to feel that the health of a person working with Pu239 will be subject to any greater absolute risk than if he were engaged in any other chemical or industrial occupation. © 1959 Health Physics Society.",,"plutonium; article; metabolism; PLUTONIUM/metabolism; PLUTONIUM/metabolism; Plutonium",,"plutonium, 7440-07-5; Plutonium, 7440-07-5",,,,,"Langham, W.H.; Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, , Los Alamos, NM, United States",,,,,,,,00179078,,,"14413981","English","Health Phys.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000308507
