In most cases, these threat groups are state sponsored which makes them extremely well financed, organised and resourced. The attack payloads range from data exfiltration and theft to the undermining of critical national infrastructure. These attacks differ from the typical cyberattacks in several different ways but a key differentiation is their patient “low and slow” approach to prevent detection. This approach, although slow, has been very successful and in many cases, detection is years after initial infection. Many of the attacks detected today, have been over a decade in the making. Most concerning is the fact that traditional defence mechanisms have been unsuccessful at detecting these attacks and so how successful will these methods be against a new generation of attacks? The earliest recording of an APT is probably “the cuckoo’s egg”. An attack in the 1980s in which a West German hacker infiltrated a series of computers in California and over time stole state secrets relating to the US “Star Wars” program. The hacker then sold the information to the Soviet KGB. Although at this point in time, cyber defence was not a government sponsored military department, it raised awareness of just how powerful this threat could be. Since then, worldwide attacks in the private and public sectors have grown exponentially and today, all governments have cyber warfare units. Most APT attacks are state sponsored; however, this does not mean that attacks are limited to government entities. Far from it. These attacks affect individuals, companies, corporations and governments globally. Attacks can and do encompass a multitude of sophisticated techniques and affect not only the traditional LAN/WAN environments but could also contaminate new generation networks such as mobile 5G networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) and Internet of Things (IoT) to name but a few. Dealing with these attacks is challenging, most attacks take years to be discovered and traditional detection mechanisms have been woefully inadequate. The age of machine learning and artificial intelligence has brought significant improvement to the detection challenges faced. These fields allow us to look for far more than attack signatures and characteristics. They allow us to look for patterns of behaviour through massive data quantities at speeds previously unimaginable. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced persistent threats; APTs; Artificial intelligence; Cyberattacks; Machine learning; Malware; Threat actors",,,,,,,"Adair, S., Deibert, R., Rohozinski, R., Villeneuve, N., Walton, G., (2010) SHADOWS IN THE CLOUD: Investigating Cyber Espionage 2.0|Online Safety & Privacy|Computer Security.

This is effective when they deal with traditional threats, but it is less effective when it comes to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors. APT attacks are carried by highly skilled (possibly state-sponsored) cyber criminal groups who have potentially unlimited time and resources. This paper analyzes three specific APT groups targeting critical national infrastructure of western countries, namely: APT28, Red October, and Regin. Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) was used as the reference model to analyze these APT groups activities. We create a Defense Triage Process (DTP) as a novel combination of the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, CKC, and 7D Model, to triage the attack vectors and potential targets for these three APT groups. A comparative summary of these APT groups is presented, based on their attack impact and deployed technical mechanism. This paper also highlights the type of organization and vulnerabilities that are attractive to these APT groups and proposes mitigation actions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Advanced persistent attack; APT; APT28; Critical national infrastructure; Red October; Regin",,,,,,,"Walker-Roberts, S., Hammoudeh, M., Dehghantanha, A., A systematic review of the availability and efficacy of countermeasures to internal threats in healthcare critical infrastructure (2018) IEEE Access, pp. 1-1; Haddadpajouh, H., Dehghantanha, A., Khayami, R., Choo, K.K.R., A deep recurrent neural network based approach for internet of things Malware threat hunting, future generation computer system (2017) Futur Gener Comput Syst, 85, pp. 88-96; Ussath, M., Jaeger, D., Cheng, F., Meinel, C., Advanced persistent threats: Behind the scenes (2016) 2016 Annual Conference on Information Science and Systems (CISS), pp. 181-186. , pp; Azmoodeh, A., Dehghantanha, A., Choo, K.-K., Robust malware detection for internet of (Battlefield) things devices using deep Eigenspace learning (2018) IEEE Trans Sustain Comput, pp. 1-1; Min, M., Xiao, L., Xie, C., Hajimirsadeghi, M., Mandayam, N.B., Defense against advanced persistent threats: A Colonel Blotto game approach (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 1-6. , pp; Hopkins, M., Dehghantanha, A., Exploit kits: The production line of the cybercrime economy?

Botnet is a digital weapon used by attackers to commit cybercrime in stealthiest way for all type of illegal online activity. Botnet is well articulated attack responsible for many malicious activities in large volume and mass effective against any targeted organization such as confidential data theft, financial loss, distribution of pirated products, e-business extortion and network or service disruption. Because of its global nature of infection and innovative covert techniques of malware development to evade detection, it is also known as advance persistent threat. An analysis of this APT revealed the advancement in sophistication of bot malware by encryption methods, concealed network connections and silent escape as an effective tool for profit-motivated e-crime. Reverse engineering is procedure to analyze malware to classify its type, hazard, impact on machine, information outflow and removal of signature technique. Botnet (APT) detection needs improvised process to identify the channel, architecture and encryption weakness. In bot examination; Programming style, network protocol and behavior analysis can mitigate the APT by creating signature, prototype of behavior based approach and elimination of C&C servers. Reverse engineering is excellent way for defense the modern botnets to immune valuable information by identifying the evidence behavior, log collection and digital forensics. The main aim of study is to determine the most adequate approach to recreate a botnet incident. Network security is prime concern to avoid state sponsored attacks like botnet so security of digital nation and e-governance can be assured. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","APT; BOTNET; Botware; Cyber forensics; Cyber security; Dynamic analysis; Malware; Malware analysis; Mirai; Network security; Reverse engineering; Robot network; Static analysis","Botnet; C (programming language); Classification (of information); Computer crime; Crime; Cryptography; Digital forensics; Dynamic analysis; Forensic engineering; Government data processing; Intelligent systems; Losses; Malware; Network protocols; Reverse engineering; Static analysis; Telemedicine; Botware; Cyber forensics; Cyber security; Malware analysis; Mirai; Robot networks; Network security",,,,,,"Thakar, B., Parekh, C., Advance persistent threat: Botnet (2016) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for Competitive Strategies, , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2905055.2905360, ICTCS 2016, Udaipur, India, 4–5 March, ACM, New York, Famous Botnet table; Sikorski, M., Honig, A., Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software, , 978-1-59327-290-6; Ligh, M., Adair, S., Hartstein, B., Richard, M., Malware Analyst’s Cookbook., , 978-0-470-61303-0; Ashley, D., Analysis of a Simple HTTP Bot, , https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/analysis-simple-http-bot-33573, SANS Institute whitepapers; Satrya, G.B., Cahyani, N.D.W., Andreta, R.F., The detection of 8 type malware botnet using hybrid malware analysis in executable file windows operating systems (2015) Proceedings of the 17Th International Conference on Electronic Commerce 2015, , ICEC 2015.
