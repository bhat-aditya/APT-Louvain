This discovery takes place through a phase of an incident response operation called Threat Hunting, where defenders track down attackers within the compromised network. In this article, we propose a formal model that dissects and abstracts elements of an attack, from both attacker and defender perspectives. This model leads to the construction of two persistent graphs on a common set of objects and components allowing for (1) an omniscient actor to compare, for both defender and attacker, the gap in knowledge and perceptions; (2) the attacker to become aware of the traces left on the targeted network; (3) the defender to improve the quality of Threat Hunting by identifying false-positives and adapting logging policy to be oriented for investigations. In this article, we challenge this model using an attack campaign mimicking APT29, a real-world threat, in a scenario designed by the MITRE Corporation. We measure the quality of the defensive architecture experimentally and then determine the most effective strategy to exploit data collected by the defender in order to extract actionable Cyber Threat Intelligence, and finally unveil the attacker. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threat; IOC; SIEM; tactics techniques procedures; threat hunting","Computer networks; Cyber threats; False positive; Formal model; Incident response; Real-world; Networks (circuits)",,,,,,,,"Thompson, E.C., Threat hunting (2020) Designing a HIPAA-Compliant Security Operations Center, , Berkeley, CA, USA: Apress; Maymi, F., Bixler, R., Jones, R.M., Lathrop, S.D., Towards a definition of cyberspace tactics, techniques and procedures (2017) Proc.

The selection of suitable features for detecting targeted cyber attacks is crucial to achieving high performance and to address limited computational and storage costs. The evaluation was performed on a semi-synthetic dataset, which combined the CICIDS2017 dataset and the Contagio malware dataset. The CICIDS2017 dataset is a benchmark dataset in the intrusion detection field and the Contagio malware dataset contains real advanced persistent threat (APT) attack traces. Several different combinations of datasets were used to increase variety in background data and contribute to the quality of results. For the feature extraction, the CICflowmeter tool was used. For the selection of suitable features, a correlation analysis including an in-depth feature investigation by boxplots is provided. Based on that, several suitable features were allocated into different feature sets. The influences of these feature sets on the detection capabilities were investigated in detail with the local outlier factor method. The focus was especially on attacks detected with different feature sets and the influences of the background on the detection capabilities with respect to the local outlier factor method. Based on the results, we could determine a superior feature set, which detected most of the malicious flows. © 2021 by the authors.

This has created a data-rich digital era, which is in fact an excellent opportunity for hackers and threat vectors leading to cybercrime. In fact, cybercrime has been progressing at the highest pace in last few years. Advanced Persistent Threat or APT is a highly sophisticated threat. Initially, such attacks focused and targeted government, state, or financial institutions only. However, recent breach reports and studies have started to indicate the trend of APT involving wider domains.

However, pattern matching-based methods have a major drawback that it can be bypassed through various modified techniques. These advanced persistent threats cause limitation to the pattern matching-based detecting mechanism, because they are not only more sophisticated than usual threats but also specialized in the targeted attacking object. The defense mechanism should have to comprehend unusual phenomenons or behaviors to successfully handles the advanced threats. To achieve this, various security techniques based on machine learning have been developed recently. Among these, anomaly detection algorithms, which are trained in unsupervised fashion, are capable of reducing efforts of security experts and securing labeled dataset through post analysis. It is further possible to distinguish abnormal behaviors more precisely by training classification models if sufficient amounts of labeled dataset is obtained through post analysis of anomaly detection results. In this study, we proposed an end-to-end abnormal behavior detection method based on sequential information preserving log embedding algorithms and machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms. Contrary to other machine learning based system anomaly detection models, which borrow domain experts' knowledge to extract significant features from the log data, raw log data are transformed into a fixed size of continuous vector regardless of their length, and these vectors are used to train the anomaly detection models. Experimental results based on a real system call trace dataset, our proposed log embedding method with unsupervised anomaly detection model yielded a favorable performance, at most 0.8708 in terms of AUROC, and it can be further improved up to 0.9745 with supervised classification algorithms if sufficient labeled attack log data become available. © 2013 IEEE.","ADFA-LD; advanced persistent threat; cyber security; System anomaly detection; system log embedding","Classification (of information); Data mining; Embeddings; Intrusion detection; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Pattern matching; Signal detection; Supervised learning; Abnormal behavior detections; Anomaly detection models; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Classification models; Embedding algorithms; Sequential information; Supervised classification; Unsupervised anomaly detection; Anomaly detection",,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF

The existing conventional security approaches have demonstrated limited success against some of the more complex cyber-attacks. This is primarily due to the sophistication of the attacks and the availability of powerful tools. Interconnected devices such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are also increasing attack exposures due to the increase in vulnerabilities. Over the last few years, we have seen a trend moving towards embracing edge technologies to harness the power of IoT devices and 5G networks. Edge technology brings processing power closer to the network and brings many advantages, including reduced latency, while it can also introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Smart cities are also dependent on technologies where everything is interconnected. This interconnectivity makes them highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, especially by the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), as these vulnerabilities are amplified by the need to integrate new technologies with legacy systems. Cybercriminals behind APT attacks have recently been targeting the IoT ecosystems, prevalent in many of these cities. In this paper, we used a publicly available dataset on Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and developed a data-driven approach for detecting APT stages using the Cyber Kill Chain. APTs are highly sophisticated and targeted forms of attacks that can evade intrusion detection systems, resulting in one of the greatest current challenges facing security professionals. In this experiment, we used multiple machine learning classifiers, such as Naïve Bayes, Bayes Net, KNN, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We used Weka performance metrics to show the numeric results. The best performance result of 91.1% was obtained with the Naïve Bayes classifier. We hope our proposed solution will help security professionals to deal with APTs in a timely and effective manner. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

This attack technique has been recognized as one of the cyber attacks trend in the world for many years. Therefore, the task of the early detection of APT attacks in information security systems is very necessary today. In this paper, we propose a method of detecting APT attacks based on network flow analysis. Accordingly, network traffic data will be processed into flow networks. Then we use machine learning algorithms to analyze network flow in order to find signs of APT attacks in the system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

To take away this asymmetric advantage, Moving Target Defense (MTD) continuously shifts the configuration of the underlying system, in turn reducing the success rate of cyberattacks. In this survey, we analyze the recent advancements made in the development of MTDs and highlight (1) how these defenses can be defined using common terminology, (2) can be made more effective with the use of artificial intelligence techniques for decision making, (3) be implemented in practice and (4) evaluated. We first define an MTD using a simple and yet general notation that captures the key aspects of such defenses. We then categorize these defenses into different sub-classes depending on what they move, when they move and how they move. In trying to answer the latter question, we showcase the use of domain knowledge and game-theoretic modeling can help the defender come up with effective and efficient movement strategies. Second, to understand the practicality of these defense methods, we discuss how various MTDs have been implemented and find that networking technologies such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization act as key enablers for implementing these dynamic defenses. We then briefly highlight MTD test-beds and case-studies to aid readers who want to examine or deploy existing MTD techniques. Third, our survey categorizes proposed MTDs based on the qualitative and quantitative metrics they utilize to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of security and performance. We use well-defined metrics such as risk analysis and performance costs for qualitative evaluation and metrics based on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA), attack representation, QoS impact, and targeted threat models for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we show that our categorization of MTDs is effective in identifying novel research areas and highlight directions for future research. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","advanced persistent threats; artificial intelligence; attack representation methods (ARMs); cyber deception; cyber kill chain (CKC); Cyber security; game theory; moving target defense; network function virtualization (NFV); network security; QoS metrics; qualitative metrics; quantitative metrics; risk analysis; software-defined networking (SDN)","Decision making; Game theory; Network function virtualization; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Surveys; Artificial intelligence techniques; Game-theoretic model; Moving target defense; Networking technology; Qualitative evaluations; Quantitative evaluation; Quantitative metrics; Security and performance; Network security",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1723440, 61571375, 61628201, DGE-1723440, OAC-1642031, SaTC-1528099

IT administrators need tools that allow for the early detection of these attacks. Several approaches have been proposed to provide solutions to this problem based on the attack life cycle. Recently, machine learning techniques have been implemented in these approaches to improve the problem of detection. This paper aims to propose a new approach to APT detection, using machine learning techniques, and is based on the life cycle of an APT attack. The proposed model is organised into two passive stages and three active stages to adapt the mitigation techniques based on machine learning. © 2020 by the authors.","Advanced persistent threats; Cybersecurity; Machine learning; Malware detection",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU

In order to test these methods properly, it is crucial to have a suitable dataset. This paper provides a review on datasets and their creation for use in APT detection in literature. A special focus is placed on feature engineering, including construction, selection and dimensionality reduction. Two use cases based on the underlying infrastructure are distinguished, large enterprise networks and Cyber Physical System, additionally including cloud computing systems, financial technology networks and Internet of Things networks. These datasets are usually based on an attack model. A description of different stages including approaches and goals of such attacks are given. The major achievement is the description and analysis of existing feature extraction methodologies and detailed overview of datasets used in APT detection related literature. This shows that the large enterprise network use case, has incorporated a much more frequent use of datasets with quite short periods of time. In the case of Cyber Physical System, a realistic dataset is publicly available. © 2020","Advanced persistent threat; Attack models; Cloud computing systems; Cyber physical system; Dataset creation; Enterprise networks; Feature extraction; Fintech; Internet of things","Cloud computing; Cyber Physical System; Dimensionality reduction; Embedded systems; Extraction; Fintech; Internet of things; Large dataset; Network security; Statistical tests; Advanced persistent threat; Attack model; Automated detection; Dataset creation; Different stages; Enterprise networks; Feature engineerings; Technology network; Feature extraction",,,,,,"This work was funded by Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).",,"https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/05/corporate-iot-a-path-to-intrusion/, Accessed, : 2019-11-20; Al-Mohannadi, H., Mirza, Q., Namanya, A., Awan, I., Cullen, A., Disso, J., Cyber-attack modeling analysis techniques: An overview (2016) 2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW), pp. 69-76; Al Salami, S., Baek, J., Salah, K., Damiani, E., Lightweight encryption for smart home (2016) 2016 11th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES), pp. 382-388. , IEEE; Alshamrani, A., Myneni, S., Chowdhary, A., Huang, D., A survey on advanced persistent threats: techniques, solutions, challenges, and research opportunities (2019) IEEE Commun.

Episodes like Stuxnet, Irongate, BlackEnergy3, etc., showed that cyberattacks causing kinetic effects have become a concrete threat. This is particularly concerning in relation to the chemical process industry (CPI) as disruptions could involve the release of hazardous materials and result in catastrophic effects. So far, OT-targeted cyber-attacks are considered so complex that only sophisticated teams with significant technical and organisational resources are likely to succeed. This paper provides a critical review of the most relevant elements with a focus on the petrol-chemical sector. It will first discuss why OT is inherently insecure. It will then analyse how the cyber-threat has evolved and it will review relevant OT-targeted cyberattacks. Finally, it will introduce the concept of advanced persistent threats (APT) and discuss their characterisation and modus operandi. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

This threat represents a risk to all organisations, specifically if they manage sensitive data or critical infrastructures. Recently, the analysis of these threats has caught the attention of the scientific community. Researchers have studied the behaviour of this threat to create models and tools that allow early detection of these attacks. The use of Artificial Intelligence can help to detect, alert and automatically predict these types of threats and reduce the time the attacker can stay on a network organisation. The objective of this work is a review of the proposed models to identify the tools and methods that they have used. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced persistent threats; Artificial intelligence; Cybersecurity; Detection; Machine learning; Malware","Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Error detection; Learning systems; Advanced persistent threats; Cyber security; Network organisation; Scientific community; Sensitive datas; Threat detection; Tools and methods; Malware",,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU

In this respect, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is regarded as a highly targeted and sophisticated attack using zero-day malware, stealth, and multiple advanced techniques to gain entry and maintain its presence inside organizational network unnoticed. Being a threat that exploits technical as well as organizational vulnerabilities, preventing it at the security perimeter and, detecting it once it enters the system is a challenge till date. To demonstrate the application of SD in identifying and analyzing the effect of each of the variables, we took the Equinox data breach as a case study. The variables leading to the breach were identified, entered into Vensim software and simulated to get the results. Through this exercise, we could identify seven key independent management variables for the technical security and three key independent variables for records breach. This research being the foremost study to apply SD to APT, we presume that by modelling APT attacks using SD through a case study this paper, thus provides insights into the dynamics of the threat. Furthermore, it suggests 'what if' strategies to minimize APT risks thereby reduce the extent of damages should an APT attack occur. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber-threats; Data breach; Systems dynamic","Cloud computing; Social sciences computing; System theory; Advanced persistent threats; Cyber threats; Data breach; Independent variables; Organizational network; Systems dynamics; Technical security; Vensim softwares; Malware",,,,,,,,"Trček, D., Using systems dynamics for human resources management in information systems security (2006) Kybernetes, 35 (7-8), pp. 1014-1023; Georgantzas, N.C., Katsamakas, E.G., Information systems research with system dynamics (2008) System Dynamics Review: The Journal of the System Dynamics Society, 24 (3), pp. 247-264; Martinez-Moyano, I.J., Rich, E., Conrad, S., Andersen, D.F., Stewart, T.R., A behavioral theory of insider-threat risks: A system dynamics approach (2008) ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS), 18 (2), p. 7; Hunker, J., Probst, C.W., Insiders and insider threats-an overview of definitions and mitigation techniques (2011) JoWUA, 2 (1), pp. 4-27; Wang, Y., Wang, Y., Liu, J., Huang, Z., A network gene-based framework for detecting advanced persistent threats (2014) 2014 Ninth International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing, pp. 97-102. , November.

APT refers to knowledgeable human attackers that are organized, highly sophisticated and motivated to achieve their objectives against a targeted organization(s) over a prolonged period. Strategically-motivated APTs or S-APTs are distinct in that they draw their objectives from the broader strategic agenda of third parties such as criminal syndicates, nation-states, and rival corporations. In this paper we review the use of the term “advanced persistent threat,” and present a formal definition. We then draw on military science, the science of organized conflict, for a theoretical basis to develop a rigorous and holistic model of the stages of an APT operation which we subsequently use to explain how S-APTs execute their strategically motivated operations using tactics, techniques and procedures. Finally, we present a general disinformation model, derived from situation awareness theory, and explain how disinformation can be used to attack the situation awareness and decision making of not only S-APT operators, but also the entities that back them. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced persistent threat; APT; Cybersecurity; Information security management; Situation awareness theory; Strategic disinformation","Decision making; Security of data; Advanced persistent threat; Cyber security; Information security managements; Situation awareness; Strategic disinformation; Decision theory",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP160102277","This work is supported by the Australian Research Council through the Discovery Projects scheme ( DP160102277 ) – Enhancing Information Security Management through Organisational Learning.",,"Ahmad, A., Bosua, R., Scheepers, R., Protecting organizational competitive advantage: a knowledge leakage perspective (2014) Comput.

Advanced persistent threat (APT) is currently one of the most important threats considering the information security concept. APT persistently collects data from a specific target by exploiting vulnerabilities using diverse attack techniques. Many researchers have contributed to find approaches and solutions to fight against network intrusion and malicious software. However, only a few of these solutions are particularly focused on APT. In this paper, we introduce a structured study on semantic-aware work to find potential contributions that analyze and detect APT in details. We propose modeling phase that discusses the typical steps in APT attacks to collect the desired information by attackers. Our research explores social network and web infrastructure exploitation as well as communication protocols and much more for future networks and communications. The paper also includes some recent Zero-day attacks, use case scenarios and cyber trends in southeastern countries. To overcome these challenges and attacks, we introduce a detailed comprehensive literature evaluation scheme that classifies and provides countermeasures of APT attack behavior. Furthermore, we discuss future research direction of APT defense framework of next-generation threat life cycle. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","APT; Exploitation; Threat; Vulnerability; Zero-day attack","Life cycle; Semantics; Exploitation; Future research directions; Network intrusions; Threat; Use case scenario; Vulnerability; Web infrastructure; Zero day attack; Network security",,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: R-20160222-002755

APT could cause disastrous impact to the targeted FI and the country's economy if there is a lack of preparation to confront these challenges and attacks. A case study on local FI was carried out to examine the influencing factors of APT awareness among FI's cybersecurity practitioners and to investigate the security strategies employed by FI to protect them from APT attacks. Feedback from CyberSecurity Malaysia (CSM) was sought to validate the findings. It was found that the factors that influence APT awareness in local FI include the emphasis on informal learning on APT, attackers' financial motivation, the FI's reputational risks and the availability of financial regulatory requirements to combat any cybersecurity risks. The awareness has led cybersecurity practitioners in local FI to implement advanced security technologies and integrated security controls as their readiness to defend FI against APT attacks. © 2018 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threats; APT; Cybersecurity; FI; Financial institutions","Advanced persistent threats; Customer information; Cyber security; Financial institution; Financial motivation; Integrated security control; Intelligence gathering; Regulatory requirements; Finance",,,,,,,,"(2016) Industry Drill-Down Report, , https://www.forcepoint.com/content/2015-industry-drill-downreport, Forcepoint 2015.

APT attacks are one of the most difficult attacks in cyber attacks. The complexity and variability of APT attack behavior greatly increases the difficulty of attack detection. In order to cope with APT attack, some well-known network security companies at home and abroad have developed a commercial APT intrusion detection system. This highly targeted attack can not be identified by the traditional intrusion detection system. Therefore, in order to deal with this new type of cyber attack. The paper proposes a new method to detect APT attack from different organizations. Data mining algorithm is used to analyze every organization’s APT network attack behavior and obtain association rules, so as to customize the design of the Snort rules and apply them to intrusion detection system. Experiments have shown that the evaluation index of the intrusion detection system using the extended Snort rule is significantly better than the traditional Snort intrusion detection system when detecting the same test data. The precision of the extended Snort intrusion detection system is as high as 98.3%, and the false alarm rate is almost 0, which ultimately achieves the purpose of APT detection. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","APT; Data mining; Network behavior; Snort rule","Computer crime; Crime; Data mining; Intrusion detection; Trusted computing; Websites; Data mining algorithm; Evaluation index; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network behavior analysis; Network behaviors; Security protection; Snort rule; Targeted attacks; Network security",,,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2016YFB0801304","Acknowledgments.

APT refers to a persistent, multi-stage attack with the intention to compromise the system and gain information from the targeted system, which has the potential to cause significant damage and substantial financial loss. The accurate detection and prediction of APT is an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a novel machine learning-based system entitled MLAPT, which can accurately and rapidly detect and predict APT attacks in a systematic way. The MLAPT runs through three main phases: (1) Threat detection, in which eight methods have been developed to detect different techniques used during the various APT steps. The implementation and validation of these methods with real traffic is a significant contribution to the current body of research; (2) Alert correlation, in which a correlation framework is designed to link the outputs of the detection methods, aims to identify alerts that could be related and belong to a single APT scenario; and (3) Attack prediction, in which a machine learning-based prediction module is proposed based on the correlation framework output, to be used by the network security team to determine the probability of the early alerts to develop a complete APT attack. MLAPT is experimentally evaluated and the presented system is able to predict APT in its early steps with a prediction accuracy of 84.8%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced persistent threat; Alert correlation; Cyber attacks; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning; Malware","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Crime; Forecasting; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Losses; Network security; Advanced persistent threat; Alert correlation; Attack prediction; Cyber-attacks; Detection methods; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-stage attack; Prediction accuracy; Malware",,,,,,,,"Conti, M., Dehghantanha, A., Franke, K., Watson, S., (2018), Internet of things security and forensics: Challenges and opportunities; HaddadPajouh, H., Dehghantanha, A., Khayami, R., Choo, K.-K.R., A deep recurrent neural network based approach for internet of things malware threat hunting, Future Generation Computer Systems; MacDermott, A., Baker, T., Shi, Q., Iot forensics: Challenges for the ioa era (2018) New Technologies, Mobility and Security, NTMS, 2018 9th IFIP International Conference on, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Morgan, S., Hackerpocalypse: A Cybercrime Revelation, Cybercrime Report (2016), Cybersecurity Ventures; Epiphaniou, G., Karadimas, P., Ismail, D.K.B., Al-Khateeb, H., Dehghantanha, A., Choo, K.-K.R., Non-reciprocity compensation combined with turbo codes for secret key generation in vehicular ad hoc social iot networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal; Walker-Roberts, S., Hammoudeh, M., Dehghantanha, A., A systematic review of the availability and efficacy of countermeasures to internal threats in healthcare critical infrastructure, IEEE Access; Aparicio-Navarro, F.J., Kyriakopoulos, K.G., Gong, Y., Parish, D.J., Chambers, J.A., Using pattern-of-life as contextual information for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 22177-22193; Al-Khateeb, H.M., Epiphaniou, G., Alhaboby, Z.A., Barnes, J., Short, E., Cyberstalking: Investigating formal intervention and the role of corporate social responsibility (2017) Telemat.

They are customized, multi-vector, staged in multiple flows and targeted. Moreover, new hacking playgrounds appeared to reach mobile network, modern architectures and smart cities. For that purpose, malware use different entry points and plug-ins. In addition, they are now deploying several techniques for obfuscation, camouflage and analysis resistance. On the other hand, antiviral protections are positioning innovative approaches exposing malicious indicators and anomalies, revealing assumptions of the limitations of the anti-antiviral mechanisms. Primarily, this paper exposes a state of art in computer virology and then introduces a new concept to create undetectable malware based on the blockchain technology. It summarizes techniques adopted by malicious software to avoid functionalities implemented for viral detection and presents the implementation of new viral techniques that leverage the blockchain network. © 2018 IEEE.","APT; Blockchain; K-ary Virus; Malicious program; Malware","Blockchain; Computer crime; Personal computing; Antiviral mechanisms; Cyber-attacks; Entry point; Innovative approaches; Malicious program; Modern architectures; Multiple flows; Viral detection; Malware",,,,,,,,"Filiol, E., Malicious cryptology and mathematics (2012) Cryptography and Security in Computing, , Intech; You, I., Yim, K., Malware obfuscation techniques: A brief survey (2010) Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 297-300. , IEEE; Cohen, F., Computer viruses: Theory and experiments (1987) Computers &Security, 6 (1), pp. 22-35; Moubarak, J., Chamoun, M., Filiol, E., Comparative study of recent mea malware phylogeny (2017) Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS), 2017 2nd International Conference on, pp. 16-20. , IEEE; Moubarak, J., Filiol, E., Chamoun, M., Comparative analysis of blockchain technologies and tor network: Two faces of the same reality?

Among the serious attacks, Advanced Persistent threat (APT) has emerged as a big challenge to the cyber security hitting selected companies and organisations. The main objectives of APT are data exfiltration and intelligence appropriation. As part of the APT life cycle, an attacker creates a Point of Entry (PoE) to the target network. This is usually achieved by installing malware on the targeted machine to leave a back-door open for future access. A common technique employed to breach into the network, which involves the use of social engineering, is the spear phishing email. These phishing emails may contain disguised executable files. This paper presents the disguised executable file detection (DeFD) module, which aims at detecting disguised exe files transferred over the network connections. The detection is based on a comparison between the MIME type of the transferred file and the file name extension. This module was experimentally evaluated and the results show a successful detection of disguised executable files. © 2018 ACM.","Advanced persistent threat; Cyber attacks; Disguised executable file; Intrusion detection system; Malware; Spear-phishing emails","Crime; Electronic mail; Intrusion detection; Life cycle; Losses; Malware; Network security; Advanced persistent threat; Cyber-attacks; Executable files; Intrusion Detection Systems; Spear phishing; Computer crime",,,,,,,,"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nhs-cyber-attack/, The-Sun, NHS cyber attack, Accessed: 01-09-2017; Walker-Roberts, S., Hammoudeh, M., Dehghantanha, A., A systematic review of the availability and efficacy of countermeasures to internal threats in healthcare critical infrastructure (2018) IEEE Access; Salem, A., Rabie, K.M., Hamdi, K.A., Alsusa, E., Tonello, A.M., Physical layer security of cooperative relaying power-line communication systems (2016) International Symposium on Power Line Communications, , IEEE; Badarneh, O.S., Sofotasios, P.C., Muhaidat, S., Cotton, S.L., Rabie, K., Al-Dhahir, N., (2018) On the Secrecy Capacity of Fisher-snedecor F Fading Channels, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1805.09260; Salem, A., Hamdi, K.A., Rabie, K.M., Performance analysis of secrecy capacity for two hop af relay networks with zero forcing (2015) Communications (ICC), 2015 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 7353-7358. , IEEE; Salem, A., Hamdi, K.A., Rabie, K.M., Physical layer security with rf energy harvesting in af multi-antenna relaying networks (2016) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 64 (7), pp. 3025-3038; Morgan, S., Hackerpocalypse: A cybercrime revelation (2016) 2016 Cybercrime Report, Cybersecurity Ventures; MacDermo, A., Baker, T., Shi, Q., Iot forensics: Challenges for the ioa era (2018) New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS), 2018 9th IFIP International Conference on, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Asim, M., Yautsiukhin, A., Brucker, A.D., Baker, T., Shi, Q., Lempereur, B., Security policy monitoring of bpmn-based service compositions (2018) Journal of So.ware: Evolution and Process, p. e1944; Al-Sharif, S., Iqbal, F., Baker, T., Khattack, A., White-hat hacking framework for promoting security awareness (2016) New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS), 2016 8th IFIP International Conference on, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Al Sharif, S., Al Ali, M., Al Reqabi, N., Iqbal, F., Baker, T., Marrington, A., Magec: An image searching tool for detecting forged images in forensic investigation (2016) 8th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security; Ghafir, I., Prenosil, V., Advanced persistent threat attack detection: An overview (2014) International Journal of Advances in Computer Networks and Its Security (IJCNS), 4 (4), pp. 50-54. , ISSN 2250-3757; Wood, P., Nisbet, M., Egan, G., Johnston, N., Haley, K., Krishnappa, B., Tran, T.-K., Hittel, S., (2012) Symantec Internet Security Threat Report Trends for 2011, p.

This is especially severe in critical infrastructures that are accelerating the integration of IT technologies. It is then essential to further develop effective monitoring and response systems that ensure the continuity of business to face the arising set of cyber-security threats. In this paper, we study the practical applicability of a novel technique based on opinion dynamics, that permits to trace the attack throughout all its stages along the network by correlating different anomalies measured over time, thereby taking the persistence of threats and the criticality of resources into consideration. The resulting information is of essential importance to monitor the overall health of the control system and correspondingly deploy accurate response procedures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Advanced persistent threat; Detection; Opinion dynamics; Traceability","Dynamics; Error detection; Public works; Security of data; Security systems; Accurate response; Advanced persistent threat; Industrial environments; It technologies; Novel techniques; Opinion dynamics; Response systems; Traceability; Critical infrastructures",,,,,"FPU15/03213

Botnet is a digital weapon used by attackers to commit cybercrime in stealthiest way for all type of illegal online activity. Botnet is well articulated attack responsible for many malicious activities in large volume and mass effective against any targeted organization such as confidential data theft, financial loss, distribution of pirated products, e-business extortion and network or service disruption. Because of its global nature of infection and innovative covert techniques of malware development to evade detection, it is also known as advance persistent threat. An analysis of this APT revealed the advancement in sophistication of bot malware by encryption methods, concealed network connections and silent escape as an effective tool for profit-motivated e-crime. Reverse engineering is procedure to analyze malware to classify its type, hazard, impact on machine, information outflow and removal of signature technique. Botnet (APT) detection needs improvised process to identify the channel, architecture and encryption weakness. In bot examination; Programming style, network protocol and behavior analysis can mitigate the APT by creating signature, prototype of behavior based approach and elimination of C&C servers. Reverse engineering is excellent way for defense the modern botnets to immune valuable information by identifying the evidence behavior, log collection and digital forensics. The main aim of study is to determine the most adequate approach to recreate a botnet incident. Network security is prime concern to avoid state sponsored attacks like botnet so security of digital nation and e-governance can be assured. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","APT; BOTNET; Botware; Cyber forensics; Cyber security; Dynamic analysis; Malware; Malware analysis; Mirai; Network security; Reverse engineering; Robot network; Static analysis","Botnet; C (programming language); Classification (of information); Computer crime; Crime; Cryptography; Digital forensics; Dynamic analysis; Forensic engineering; Government data processing; Intelligent systems; Losses; Malware; Network protocols; Reverse engineering; Static analysis; Telemedicine; Botware; Cyber forensics; Cyber security; Malware analysis; Mirai; Robot networks; Network security",,,,,,,,"Thakar, B., Parekh, C., Advance persistent threat: Botnet (2016) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for Competitive Strategies, , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2905055.2905360, ICTCS 2016, Udaipur, India, 4–5 March, ACM, New York, Famous Botnet table; Sikorski, M., Honig, A., Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software, , 978-1-59327-290-6; Ligh, M., Adair, S., Hartstein, B., Richard, M., Malware Analyst’s Cookbook., , 978-0-470-61303-0; Ashley, D., Analysis of a Simple HTTP Bot, , https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/analysis-simple-http-bot-33573, SANS Institute whitepapers; Satrya, G.B., Cahyani, N.D.W., Andreta, R.F., The detection of 8 type malware botnet using hybrid malware analysis in executable file windows operating systems (2015) Proceedings of the 17Th International Conference on Electronic Commerce 2015, , ICEC 2015.

In this paper, the interactions between an APT attacker and a cloud system defender in their allocation of the Central Processing Units (CPUs) over multiple devices are formulated as a Colonel Blotto game (CBG), which models the competition of two players under given resource constraints over multiple battlefields. The Nash equilibria (NEs) of the CBG-based APT defense game are derived for the case with symmetric players and the case with asymmetric players each with different total number of CPUs. The expected data protection level and the utility of the defender are provided for each game at the NE. An APT defense strategy based on the policy hill-climbing (PHC) algorithm is proposed for the defender to achieve the optimal CPU allocation distribution over the devices in the dynamic defense game without being aware of the APT attack model. Simulation results have verified the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, showing that both the data protection level and the utility of the defender are improved compared with the benchmark greedy allocation algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","advanced persistent threats; cloud system; Colonel Blotto game; data protection level; policy hill-climbing",,,,,,"2016-010

APT is a highly interactive, specifically targeted and extremely harmful network-centric attack, which employs various technologies to evade detection during attacks leading to the result that victims will not be aware of attacks until they suffer from tremendous losses. Since command and control (C&C) is an essential component during the lifetime of APT, the detection of it is a practical measure to defend against the APT. In this paper, we analyze the features of C&C in APT and find that the HTTP-based C&C is widely used. Based on the analysis results, we propose a new feature of C&C, i.e., independent access, to characterize the difference between C&C communications and normal HTTP requests. Applying the independent access feature into DNS records, we implement a novel C&C detection method and validate it on public dataset. As a new feature of C&C, its advantages and drawbacks are also analyzed. © 2016 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threat; command and control; domain name service","Command and control systems; HTTP; Access features; Advanced persistent threat; Command and control; Detection methods; Domain name service; Network-centric; Practical measures; Various technologies; Computer crime",,,,,,,,"Bejtlich, R., (2007) Air Force Cyberspace Report, , http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/10/air-force-cyberspace-report.html; http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html, Google.

As a consequence, any security attribute of the computer system may be compromised: disruption of service (availability), unauthorized data modification (integrity), or exfiltration of sensitive data (confidentiality). An APT starts with the exploitation of software vulnerability within the system. Thus, vulnerability mitigation strategies must be designed and deployed in a timely manner to reduce the window of exposure of vulnerable systems. In this paper, we evaluate the survivability of a computer system under an APT attack using a Markov model. Generation and solution of the Markov model are facilitated by means of a high-level formalism based on stochastic Petri nets. Survivability metrics are defined to quantify security attributes of the system from the public announcement of a software vulnerability and during the system recovery. The proposed model and metrics not only enable us to quantitatively assess the system survivability in terms of security attributes but also provide insights on the cost/revenue tradeoffs of investment efforts in system recovery such as vulnerability mitigation strategies. Sensitivity analysis through numerical experiments is carried out to study the impact of key parameters on system secure survivability. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","APT; Cyberattacks; Markov chains; Security metrics; Stochastic reward nets; Survivability; Transient analysis","Computer system recovery; Graphic methods; Markov processes; Network security; Petri nets; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Transient analysis; Cyber-attacks; Security metrics; Software vulnerabilities; Stochastic Petri Nets; Stochastic reward nets; Survivability; Survivability analysis; Vulnerability mitigation; Computer software",,,,,"984425

On the other hand, cyber criminals and miscreants produced more advanced techniques to compromise Internet infrastructure. Targeted attack or advanced persistent threat (APT) attack is a new challenge and aims to accomplish a specific goal, most often espionage. APTs are presently the biggest threat to governments and organizations. This paper states research questions and propose a novel approach to intrusion detection system processes network traffic and able to detect potential APT attack. This detection of APT attack is based on the correlation between the events which we get as outputs of our detection methods.

However, this type of malware is less interesting to cyber security officers of larger organizations, who are more concerned with detecting malware indicative of a targeted attack. Here we investigate the potential of statistically based approaches to detect such malware using a malware family associated with a large number of targeted network intrusions. Our approach is complementary to the bulk of statistical based malware classifiers, which are typically based on measures of overall similarity between executable files. One problem with this approach is that a malicious executable that shares some, but limited, functionality with known malware is likely to be misclassified as benign. Here a new approach to malware classification is introduced that classifies programs based on their similarity with known malware subroutines. It is illustrated that malware and benign programs can share a substantial amount of code, implying that classification should be based on malicious subroutines that occur infrequently, or not at all in benign programs. Various approaches to accomplishing this task are investigated, and a particularly simple approach appears the most effective. This approach simply computes the fraction of subroutines of a program that are similar to malware subroutines whose likes have not been found in a larger benign set. If this fraction exceeds around 1.5 %, the corresponding program can be classified as malicious at a 1 in 1000 false alarm rate. It is further shown that combining a local and overall similarity based approach can lead to considerably better prediction due to the relatively low correlation of their predictions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag France (Outside the USA).","APT; Malware detection; Static analysis; Subroutine similarity","Computer crime; Computer viruses; Static analysis; Subroutines; APT; Executable files; False alarm rate; Malware classifications; Malware detection; Malware families; Network intrusions; Statistical detection; Malware",,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., Quist, D., Neil, J., Storlie, C., Lane, T., Graph-based malware detection using dynamic traces (2011) J.

Such an attack usually results in the loss of sensitive and confidential information. Because email communication is an integral part of daily business operations, APT attackers frequently leverage email as an attack vector for initial penetration of the targeted organization. Emails allow the attacker to deliver malicious attachments or links to malicious websites. Attackers usually use social engineering in order to make the recipient open the malicious email, open the attachment, or press a link. Existing defensive solutions within organizations prevent executables from entering organizational networks via emails, therefore, recent APT attacks tend to attach non-executable files (PDF, MS Office etc.) which are widely used in organizations and mistakenly considered less suspicious or malicious. This article surveys existing academic methods for the detection of malicious PDF files. The article outlines an Active Learning framework and highlights the correlation between structural incompatibility of PDF files and their likelihood of maliciousness.

Due to its distribution of diverse users and aggregation of immense data, cloud computing has increasingly been the focus of targeted attacks. Meta-analysis of industry studies and retrospective research involving cloud service providers reveal that cloud computing is demonstrably vulnerable to a particular type of targeted attack, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs have proven to be difficult to detect and defend against in cloud based infocommunication systems. The prevalent use of polymorphic malware and encrypted covert communication channels make it difficult for existing packet inspecting and signature based security technologies such as; firewalls, intrusion detection sensors, and anti-virus systems to detect APTs. In this paper, we examine the application of an alternative security approach which applies an algorithm derived from flow based monitoring to successfully detect APTs.

Since this attacking process is working continuously and uses diverse malicious codes and attacking routes, it is considered to be difficult to detect in advance. In this paper, we categorized cyber targeted attacks into four steps and defined potential behaviors of involvers like attackers or victims, in order to make a model. Each behavior of our model can include a couple of methods. Furthermore, we applied our behavior-based model to the real targeted attacks, ""3.20 South Korean Malware Attack"" and ""The Targeted Attack for SK Communications"".","3.20 DarkSeoul; APT; Behavior-based Modeling; Malicious Codes; Targeted Attacks","Command and control systems; Computer crime; Malware; 3.20 DarkSeoul; APT; Behavior based modeling; Malicious codes; Targeted Attacks; Security of data",,,,,,,,"Virvilis, N., Gritzalis, D., The big four-what we did wrong in protecting critical ICT infrastructures from Advanced Persistent Threat detection?

In the last decade, lot of research has been done, using machine learning methods on both static as well as dynamic analysis. Since the aim and objective of malware developers have changed from just for fame to political espionage or financial gain, the malware is also getting evolved in its form, and infection methods. One of the latest form of malware is known as targeted malware, on which not much research has happened. Targeted malware, which is a superset of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), is growing in its volume and complexity in recent years. Targeted Cyber attack (through targeted malware) plays an increasingly malicious role in disrupting the online social and financial systems. APTs are designed to steal corporate / national secrets and/or harm national/corporate interests. It is difficult to recognize targeted malware by antivirus, IDS, IPS and custom malware detection tools. Attackers leverage compelling social engineering techniques along with one or more zero day vulnerabilities for deploying APTs. Along with these, the recent introduction of Crypto locker and Ransom ware pose serious threats to organizations/nations as well as individuals. In this paper, we compare various machine-learning techniques used for analyzing malwares, focusing on static analysis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Advanced Persistent Threat; Cyber Defence; Machine Learning; Malware; Static Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Learning systems; Network security; Static analysis; Advanced Persistent Threat; Critical component; Cyber Defence; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Social engineering; Zero day vulnerabilities; Malware",,,,,,,,"The 'ICEFOG' APT: A tale of cloak and three daggers (2013) Kaspersky Lab Global Research and Analysis Team(GREAT); Balduzzi, M., Ciangaglini, V., McArdle, R., Targeted attacks detection with spunge (2013) Trend Micro Research, EMEA; Becker, G.T., Regazzoni, F., Paar, C., Burleson, W.P., (2013) Stealthy Dopant-level Hardware Trojans; Bencsáth, B., Pék, G., Buttyán, L., Félegyházi, M., The cousins of stuxnet: Duqu, flame, and gauss (2012) Future Internet, 4 (4), pp. 971-1003; Bilar, D., Opcodes as predictor for malware (2007) International Journal of Electronic Security and Digital Forensics, 1 (2), pp. 156-168; Blonce, A., Filiol, E., Frayssignes, L., (2008) Portable Document Format (pdf) Security Analysis and Malware Threats.

Employees'social networking behaviour, whether accidental or intentional, provides an opportunity for advanced persistent threats (APT) attackers to realise their social engineering techniques and undetectable zero-day exploits. APT attackers use a spear-phishing method that targeted on key employees of victim organisations through social media in order to conduct reconnaissance and theft of confidential proprietary information. This conceptual paper posits OSN as the most challenging channel of information leakage and provides an explanation about the underlying factors of employees leaking information via this channel through a theoretical lens from information systems. It also describes how OSN becomes an attack vector of APT owing to employees'social networking behaviour, and finally, recommends security education, training and awareness (SETA) for organisations to combat these threats.","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber espionage; Information leakage; Online social networking; Social media; Unauthorised information disclosure","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber espionage; Information disclosure; Information leakage; Social media; Industrial management; Security of data; Social networking (online); Societies and institutions; Personnel training",,,,,,,,"Ahmad, A., Ruighaver, A.B., Teo, W.T., An information-centric approach to data security in organisations (2005) TENCON 2005 2005 IEEE Region 10, , 21-24 Nov. 2005, Paper presented at the; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behaviour (1991) Organisational Behaviour and Human Decision Process, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; (2010) Israeli Military 'Unfriends' Soldier after Facebook Leak, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8549099.stm, Retrieved 9 March 2010; Bulgurcu, B., Cavusoglu, H., Benbasat, I., Information security policy compliance: An empirical study of rationality-based beliefs and information security awareness (2010) MIS Quarterly, 34 (3), pp. 523-548; Carvalho, V., Balasubramanyan, R., Cohen, W., Information leaks and suggestions: A case study using mozilla thunderbird (2009) CEAS 2009 - Sixth Conference on Email and Anti-Spam, , Paper presented at the; Christofides, E., Muise, A., Desmarais, S., Information disclosure and control on facebook: Are they two sides of the same coin or two different processes?
