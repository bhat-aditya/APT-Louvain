The Markov jumping signal, as the upper layer switching signal, is utilized to describe the jumping of system modes. Then, the persistent dwell-time switching signal is introduced as a lower layer switching signal to characterize the variation for transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Besides, the uncertainties of actual measurement output are assumed to randomly occur, which are described by a set of Bernoulli distributed white sequences. Furthermore, some sufficient conditions ensuring the filtering error system being mean-square exponentially stable with an extended dissipative performance are obtained through the Lyapunov stability theory and some advanced linear matrix transformation techniques. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021","Double-layer switching; Extended dissipativity; Singularly perturbed system; Uncertain measurement output","Linear transformations; Markov processes; Matrix algebra; Uncertainty analysis; Double layers; Double-layer switching; Dwell-time switching; Extended dissipativity; Markov jumps; Singularly perturbed systems; Switching mechanism; Switching signals; Uncertain measurement output; Uncertain measurements; Switching",,,,,"KJ2020ZD28

To overcome such adverse effects, a systematic molecular design, screening and performance evaluation approach was developed to generate functionally improved and environmentally friendly HHCB derivatives. Among the 90 designed HHCB derivatives, 15 were screened with improved functional properties (i.e., odor stability and intensity) and less environmental impacts (i.e., lower bio-toxicity, bio-accumulation ability, and mobility) using 3D-QSAR models and density functional theory methods. Their human health risks were then assessed by toxicokinetic analysis, which narrowed the candidates to four. Derivative 7, the designed molecule with the least dermal adsorption potential, was evaluated for its interaction with other PCPs additives (i.e., anti-photosensitivity materials and moisturizer) and such impacts on human health risks using molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation. The environmental fate of Derivative 7 after transformation (i.e., photodegradation, biotransformation, and chlorination) was also discussed. Biotransformation and chlorination were recognized as optimum options for Derivative 7 mitigation. This study provided the theoretical basis for the design of functionally improved and environmentally friendly HHCB alternatives and advanced the understanding of their environmental behaviors and health risks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","3D-QSAR models; Density function theory; Derivative modification; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamic simulation","Additives; Chlorination; Computational chemistry; Density functional theory; Health; Health risks; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Risk assessment; 3d-QSAR model; Density function theory; Derivative modification; Dynamics simulation; Functional modification; Galaxolide (HHCB); Human health risks; Molecular docking; Personal care products; Synthetic musks; Molecular graphics; galaxolide; polycyclic hydrocarbon; adsorption; biotransformation; chlorination; environmental fate; environmental impact; health risk; organic compound; toxicology; acute toxicity; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioaccumulation; biodegradability; biotransformation; carcinogenicity; chemical modification; chlorination; comparative molecular field analysis; comparative molecular similarity indices analysis; controlled study; cross validation; density functional theory; environmental impact; female; health hazard; LC50; male; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; mutagenicity; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; photodegradation; rat; signal noise ratio; stereoisomerism; three dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship; toxicokinetics; vapor pressure; waste water treatment plant",,"galaxolide, 1222-05-5",,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: 528169-2019

Long-term, stealthy attacks such as Stuxnet can be described as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Here, we extend our previous work on hypergames and APTs to develop hypergame-based defender strategies that are robust to deception and do not rely on attack detection. These strategies provide provable bounds - and provably optimal bounds - on the attacker payoff. Strategies based on Bayesian priors do not provide such bounds. We then numerically demonstrate our approach on a building control subsystem and discuss next steps in extending this approach toward an operational capability. © 2021 ACM.","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber-physical security; Game theory; Optimal control","Embedded systems; Network security; Robust control; Attack detection; Bayesian priors; Building control subsystems; Cyber-attacks; Hypergame; Operational capabilities; Optimal bounds; Remote monitoring and control; Computer crime",,,,,,"This work was supported by the DOE EERE Building Technologies Office, Sensors and Controls program.

Current solutions for removing PFAS from contaminated water rely on adsorption-based methods where commonly used sorbents, for example, activated carbons and ion-exchange resins, exhibit low adsorption capacity and a long equilibration time. Motivated by the generally deficient performance of these current materials, this work addresses the need for the discovery of advanced sorbents for high capacity and efficient PFAS removal. The zirconium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) NU-1000 was characterized for the adsorption of three perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs, C4-C8) and six perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs, C1-C9) from aqueous solutions. The results indicate that NU-1000 exhibits outstanding adsorption capacities of 400-620 mg/g for PFSAs and 201-604 mg/g for PFCAs coupled with ultrafast adsorption kinetics featuring equilibrium times of <1 min. Complementary density functional theory calculations reveal that the PFAS@MOF adsorption mechanism is dominated by a combination of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic non-covalent PFAS-MOF interactions. Excellent regeneration and reusability characteristics were found, particularly nearly quantitative removal and recovery rates of NU-1000 after five consecutive adsoption and desorption cycles of PFAS. Additional adsorption testing using PFAS-contaminated groundwater samples obtained from U.S. Air Force bases revealed impressive PFAS removal rates of 75-98% within 10 min regardless of the presence of co-contaminants. To the best of our knowledge, the suite of herein presented PFAS sorption characteristics - capacity, kinetics, regeneration, and reusability - significantly outperforms other current sorbents, rendering NU-1000 as a promising platform for the rapid and effective removal of PFAS from aqueous media. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

The transition probabilities of the Markov chain are assumed to be piecewise time-varying, and the persistent dwell-time switching rule, as a more general switching rule, is adopted to describe this variation characteristic. Afterwards, based on the classical Lyapunov stability theory, a Lyapunov function is established, in which the information about the Markov jump feature of the system mode and the persistent dwell-time switching of the transition probabilities is considered simultaneously. Furthermore, via using the stochastic analysis method and some advanced matrix transformation techniques, some sufficient conditions are obtained such that the estimation error system is mean-square exponentially stable with an H∞ performance level, from which the specific form of the estimator can be obtained. Finally, the rationality and effectiveness of the obtained results are verified by a numerical example. © 2021 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","H∞ state estimation; Markov jump neural networks; Meansquare exponential stability; Persistent dwell-time switching rule","Linear transformations; Lyapunov functions; Markov chains; State estimation; Stochastic systems; Switching; Dwell-time switching; Estimation errors; Lyapunov stability theory; Matrix transformation; Mean-square exponentially stables; Stochastic analysis; Transition probabilities; Variation characteristics; Neural networks",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61573008, 61703004, 61873002, 61973199, 61973200","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61873002, 61703004, 61973199, 61573008, and 61973200).",,,"Shi, P, Zhang, L X, Chadli, M, (2016) IEEE Trans.

Despite persistent failures, neoliberal environmentalism remains prevalent—and apparently without alternative. This paper directs focus on an often-overlooked dimension of this apparent stasis: the nexus of self and society in advanced capitalism, as shown in the linkage between neoliberal environmentalism and the autonomous ecoconsumer. Marcuse’s concept of repressive desublimation is engaged to better understand how environmentalist desire is currently being thwarted in ways that inhibit movement toward socioecological emancipation. The paper provides an illustrative example of desublimated environmentalist desire in the current recycling crisis. © The Author(s) 2020.","Anthropocene; climate change; critical theory; environment; environmental sociology; Marcuse; neoliberal environmentalism",,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., (1973) Negative Dialectics, , New York, NY, Continuum; Allen, A., Are we driven?

With the advent of advanced persistent threats, CPSs are more vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks that cause catastrophic damages, thereby necessitating the development of novel defence architectures for CPS security. This work presents an analytical framework based on noncooperative game theory to evaluate the trustworthiness of individual nodes that constitute CPSs. The proposed approach uses the Nash equilibrium solution to derive a minimum trust threshold score for the CPS nodes. The game-theoretic framework is evaluated on a supervisory control and data acquisition system prototype to model the evolution of the trust scores its sensors. Furthermore, we apply the model on a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system and derive the trust threshold. The trust threshold represents the minimum trust score required to be maintained by individual UAV nodes. Nodes with trust scores below the threshold are potentially malicious and may be removed or isolated to ensure the secure operation of the system. The proposed approach is successfully implemented to detect malicious behavior in a simulated multiloop UAV control system with a fewer number of false-positives, achieving a maximum accuracy of 98.85% across different scenarios. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Aircraft control; Antennas; Computation theory; Cyber Physical System; Data acquisition; Embedded systems; Network security; Ubiquitous computing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Catastrophic damage; Communication technologies; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Malicious behavior; Non-cooperative game theory; Supervisory control and data acquisition; UAV control systems; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Game theory",,,,,"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India, for supporting this work under the Visvesvaraya PhD Scheme for Electronics and IT.",,,"Tan, L., Wang, N., (2010), Future internet the internet of things.

Herein, the superior activity of the h-BN on the phenol degradation (model pollutant) compared to other metal-free catalysts, such as carbon-based ones, and the lower selectivity to CO encourage the potential application of h-BN catalysts in CWPO processes. Through a combined density functional theory calculations, experimental reactions and catalyst characterization approach, a comprehensive study on the reaction mechanism has been conducted. According to this, only defected B atoms in the h-BN layer, protonated as B-(OH2)+, decompose the hydrogen peroxide into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The radical species diffuse towards inner h-BN regions and react with the phenol adsorbed by π-π interaction on the h-BN surface. Oxidation by-products cause carbonaceous deposits and progressive deactivation of the h-BN catalyst that can be directly regenerated by burning off in air. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced oxidation processes; Boron nitride; Density functional theory; Hydrogen peroxide; Wastewater treatment","Biodegradation; Catalyst selectivity; Catalytic oxidation; Computation theory; Density functional theory; III-V semiconductors; Nitrides; Organic pollutants; Oxidation; Peroxides; Phenols; Carbonaceous deposits; Catalyst characterization; Catalytic wet peroxide oxidation; Computational approach; Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN); Metal-free catalysts; Oxidation by-products; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Boron nitride",,,,,"PEJD-2018-PRE/AMB-9019

New and emerging technologies, such as smart technological environments, imaging technologies and smart drugs, are increasingly shaping who and what we are and influencing who we ought to be. How should we adequately understand, evaluate and appreciate this development? Tackling this question requires going beyond the persistent and stubborn inside-outside dualism and recognizing that what we consider our “inside” self is to a great extent shaped by our “outside” world. Inspired by various philosophers - especially Nietzsche, Peirce and Lacan -this book shows how the values, goals and ideals that humans encounter in their environments not only shape their identities but also enable them to critically relate to their present state. The author argues against understanding technological self-formation in terms of making ourselves better, stronger and smarter. Rather, we should conceive it in terms of technological sublimation, which redefines the very notion of human enhancement. In this respect the author introduces an alternative, more suitable theory, namely Technological Sublimation Theory (TST). Extimate Technology will be of interest to scholars and advanced students working in philosophy of technology, philosophy of the self, phenomenology, pragmatism, and history of philosophy.

Patent data is rich in information about technology and the development in various technical fields. Understanding the development trends of technology in patents is incredibly beneficial for future research and industrial development of advanced technology. This research analyzes the co-occurrence of technical fields at a large scale based on the International Patent Classification (IPC) numbers issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the industrial matching relationships in the technical fields. Subsequently, according to entropy theory, we investigate the technological convergence in 35 technological fields. After that, complementary convergence and substitution convergence among several fields are analyzed. It is found that the technological convergence of the chemical industry has been the most persistent in the past 20 years. The information technology industry has also grown rapidly in technological convergence in recent years. The results could help guide the direction of in-depth research within the entire industry and other prominent industries. © 2021 18th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2021.

In this article, we have tried to trace the evolutionary journey of cardiovascular science from a rudimentary form in ancient period to a robust scientific discipline in modern times. Methods: A literature search of relevant, peer-reviewed, published articles was undertaken from indexed databases (Medline & Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science and Google Scholar). Results: Cardiovascular science has its roots in antiquity, when Greek scholars mostly relied on philosophical thoughts and ancient texts. This was followed by addition of few structural details to the theory of circulation by Galen based on animal dissection. Arab scholar Ibn al–Nafis provided new insights regarding circulation pathway in humans. Nevertheless, an erroneous concept prevailed into the onset of European Renaissance. Even with legalization of human dissection, little headway could be made till sixteenth century due to persistent reliance of anatomists on ancient Galenic principles. During seventeenth century, the circulatory pathway (as we know it today) was established due to significant contributions from scholars like Harvey and Malpighi. Their efforts were based on findings from experiments and logical conclusions. Eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of autopsy based methods which led to valuable contributions from Vieussens, Thebesius, Morgagni and Hunter regarding normal and pathologic anatomy of cardiovascular system. With structural details mostly established, researchers during nineteenth century focussed on innovations in diagnostic methods based on human experiments. Further development of advanced human experiment models during twentieth century led to emergence of contemporary treatment methods for various cardiac conditions. In the twenty-first century, cardiovascular science is undergoing comprehensive progress at an exponential rate due to technological advances. Conclusion: The evolutionary journey of cardiovascular science as a discipline across centuries has been intriguing and eventful. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Blood vessels; Circulation; Heart; Human experiments; Microscopy; Pathologic anatomy; Technology","Antiquity; Arab; article; autopsy; blood vessel; Cinahl; dissection; Embase; heart; human; Medline; microscopy; pathological anatomy; Scopus; search engine; systematic review; Web of Science",,,,,,"None to declare.",,,"Gal, D., Thijs, B., Glänzel, W., Sipido, K.R., Hot topics and trends in cardiovascular research (2019) Eur Heart J, 40, pp. 2363-2374; Reichert, P., A history of the development of cardiology as a medical specialty (1978) Clin Cardiol, 1, pp. 5-15; Nutton, V., Ancient medicine (2004), p. 504. , Routledge New York; Shoja, M.M., Tubbs, R.S., Loukas, M., Ardalan, M.R., The Aristotelian account of “heart and veins” (2008) Int J Cardiol, 125, pp. 304-310; Lewis, O., Praxagoras of cos on arteries, pulse and pneuma.

As the core of sensitive data storage and business interaction, the SDN is vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APT) attacks, while honeypots have shown great promise against APT attacks. In this paper, we propose a new SDN-based dynamic bounded rational honeypot-APT game model in IIoT. Specifically, the defender maximizes the utility by chossing the period strategy of honeypot collecting and analyzing the data, while the attacker maximizes utility by choosing the period strategy of its latency and attack. To describe the bounded rationality, we model the simultaneous dynamic attack and defense process through the prospect theory, in which the Prelec function and the value function are both introduced. Experiment results show that bounded rationality affects strategy selection and reduces defender and attacker&#x2019;s utilities. Furthermore, our strategy outperforms the existing work in defensive performance.

Finally, this paper validated the model by an instance of APT attack, the calculated results showed that the model can analyze the attacker and defender from the attack path, and can provide a reasonable defense scheme for organizations that use distributed networks. © 2021 IEEE.","APT attack; game model; network defense framework","Network security; Predictive analytics; Attack path; Defensive strategies; Distributed network structures; Distributed networks; Game equilibrium; Game models; Maximum revenue; Problem-based; Game theory",,,,,,,,,"Baldonado, R.S., Zhu, Q., Gadapt: A sequential game-Theoretic framework for designing defense-in-depth strategies against advanced persistent threats[C] (2016) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security., pp. 314-326. , Springer International Publishing; Cutler, T., (2010) The Anatomy of An Advanced Persistent Threat[J]., , Wired Business Media [database online]; Feng, X., Zheng, Z., Hu, P., Stealthy attacks meets insider threats: A threeplayer game model[C] (2015) Military Communications Conference, Milcom 2015-2015 Ieee, pp. 25-30; Rass, S., König, S., Schauer, S., Defending against advanced persistent threats using game-Theory[J] (2017) PloS One, 12 (1), p. 0168675; Singh, S., Sharma, P.K., Moon, S.Y., A comprehensive study on apt attacks and countermeasures for future networks and communications: Challenges and solutions[J] (2016) The Journal of Supercomputing, pp. 1-32; Feng, X., Zheng, Z., Cansever, D., Stealthy attacks with insider information: A game theoretic model with asymmetric feedback[C] (2016) Military Communications Conference, Milcom 2016-2016 Ieee, pp. 277-282; Zhang, M., Zheng, Z., Shroff, N.B., A game theoretic model for defending against stealthy attacks with limited resources[C] (2015) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security., pp. 93-112. , Springer International Publishing; Shree, R.A.J., Khan, R.A., Wormhole attack in wireless sensor network[J] (2014) International Journal of Computer Networks and Communications Security, 2 (1), pp. 22-26; Zhu, Q., Basar, T., Game-Theoretic methods for robustness, security, and resilience of cyber physical control systems: Games-in-games principle for optimal cross-layer resilient control systems[J] (2015) Ieee Control Systems, 35 (1), pp. 46-65; Bowers, K.D., Van Dijk, M., Griffin, R., Defending against the unknown enemy: Applying flipit to system security[C] (2012) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security., pp. 248-263. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Flipit: The game of stealthy takeover[J] (2013) Journal of Cryptology, 26 (4), pp. 655-713; Pawlick, J., Farhang, S., Zhu, Q., Flip the cloud: Cyber-physical signaling games in the presence of advanced persistent threats[C] (2015) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security., pp. 289-308. , Springer International Publishing; Fang, X., Zhai, L., Jia, Z., A game model for predicting the attack path of apt[C] (2014) Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC), 2014 Ieee 12th International Conference On., pp. 491-495; Laszka, A., Horvath, G., Felegyhazi, M., Flipthem: Modeling targeted attacks with flipit for multiple resources[C] (2014) International Conference on Decision and Gam e Theory for Security., pp. 175-194. , Springer International Publishing",,,"Chengdu Union Institute of Science and Technology;Chongqing Geeks Education Technology Co., Ltd;Chongqing Global Union Academy of Science and Technology;Global Union Academy of Science and Technology;IEEE Beijing Section",,"5th IEEE Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IAEAC 2021","12 March 2021 through 14 March 2021",,168296,26896621,,,,"English","Adv.

With the development of the information technologies, especially big data and artificial intelligence, many kinds of cyber attacks are emerging every day, causing severe consequences to society. Meanwhile, intelligent defense methods are proposed to detect these attacks. Such attack and defense methods are constantly being renovated. In particular, advanced persistent threats are intensifying. How to effectively prevent this type of attack has become the a vital problem in recent years. The detection and defense technologies have made great progress. This chapter mainly discusses the research progress of APT attack detection and defense strategies at home and abroad, and focuses on the practice of using machine learning methods to perform attack detection while elaborating on traditional attack detection methods. We also introduce game theory based defense strategy to find the best defense strategy in limited resources, dynamic information flow tracking and cloud platform. With the development of knowledge representation, how to use the MDATA model to characterize the APT attacks is also be discussed in this chapter. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","APT attack; Cyber defense; Cyber security; MDATA","Computer crime; Crime; Game theory; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Attack detection; Cloud platforms; Cyber-attacks; Cyberspaces; Defense strategy; Defense technologies; Dynamic information flow tracking; Machine learning methods; Network security",,,,,,,,,"Chen, R.-D., Zhang, X.-S., Niu, W.-N., Lan, H.-Y., A research on architecture of apt attack detection and countering technology (2019) J.

One of these socio-structural institutions is global capitalism. While critical scholarship has advanced our understanding of the relationships between capitalist globalization and health, more work is needed to understand the transnational economic, political, and cultural practices that affect various global health issues. This paper argues that the theory of global capitalism provides an important, critical perspective for understanding different phenomena associated with global health. The theory's key concepts of transnational corporations, financialization, consumerism, transnational social classes, and transnational state comprise the conceptual framework. When applied to various global health topics, the theory advances our understanding of the health-related institutional structures of today's global economy, provides a holistic view that integrates various strands of health research, highlights various forms of health activism, and offers new questions for addressing persistent health injustice across the world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Global capitalism; Global health; Globalization; Neoliberalism; Political economy of health; Social class; Social determinants of health; Societal determinants of health","capitalism; class; conceptual framework; economic theory; financial system; global perspective; health geography; neoliberalism; political economy; socioeconomic status; theoretical study; article; capitalism; conceptual framework; economic aspect; global health; human; medical research; multinational corporation; social class; social determinants of health; international cooperation; Capitalism; Global Health; Humans; Internationality",,,,,,,,,"Alderson, A.S., Pandian, R.K., What is really happening with global inequality?

However, novel attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) could evade detection of the intrusion detection system, which may lead to serious data leakage in cloud. Existing methods studied the countermeasures to defend against evasion attacks. However, a cloud service provider (CSP) also have to balance between its expect revenue and the security risk of system with limited resources. In this paper, we present the CSP's optimal strategy for effective and safety operation, in which the CSP decides the size of users that the cloud service will provide and whether enhanced countermeasures will be conducted for discovering the possible evasion attacks. While the CSP tries to optimize its profit by carefully making a two-step decision of the defense plan and service scale, the attacker considers its expected revenue to launch evasion attacks or not. To obtain insights of such a highly coupled system, we consider a system with one CSP and one attacker with two attack choices of whether to launch an evasion attack. We propose a two-stage Stackelberg game, in which the CSP acts as the leader who decides the defense plan and service scale in Stage I, and the attacker acts as the follower that determines whether to make evasion attacks in Stage II. We derive the Nash Equilibrium by analyzing the attacker's choices under different scenarios that the CSP selects. Then, we provide the CSP's optimal strategies to maximize its revenue. The simulation results help to better understand the CSP's optimal solutions under different situations. © 2020 IEEE.","Cloud service; Evasion attacks; Game theory; Nash Equilibrium; Stackelberg game","Chemical detection; Intrusion detection; Network security; Optimal systems; Cloud applications; Cloud service providers; Detection methods; Intrusion Detection Systems; Optimal solutions; Optimal strategies; Safety operations; Stackelberg Games; Computer crime",,,,,"A1098531023601183

While intrusion detection was mainly based on human expertise in the 1990s, learning models to predict attacks are now built from data. However, a large part of the developed learning algorithms hitherto has missed real-world issues, making them unpractical. Indeed, many supervised algorithms described in the literature have been trained and tuned only on the KDD99 dataset. Besides, these algorithms are often static and are unable to automatically adapt for detecting attacks depending on the network traffic. Consequently, we are far from detecting zero-day or more general Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) since only pre-registered and well-characterized attacks can be catched. Some recent systems use unsupervised ML algorithms, but the resulting tools are overly complex: many ML components are stacked with various tuning parameters, usually making the results hard to interpret. And finally, a strong ML/DM expertise is required to set up these systems on real networks. We present netspot, a very simple network intrusion detection system (NIDS) powered by SPOT, a recent streaming statistical anomaly detector. This statistical test uses Extreme Value Theory, which is a powerful method for detecting anomalies. Unlike all the previous works, it is not an end-to-end solution aimed to detect all cyber-attacks with packet resolution. It is rather a module providing a behavioral information which can be integrated in a more general monitoring system. netspot is simple: it has few (simple) parameters, it adapts along time to the monitored network and it is as fast as current rule-based methods. But most importantly, it is able to detect realworld cyber-attacks, making it a credible practical anomaly-based NIDS. © 2020 IEEE.","Intrusion detection systems; Network security; Statistical Learning","Computation theory; Computer crime; Crime; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Privacy by design; Anomaly-based NIDS; End-to-end solutions; Extreme value theory; Intrusion Detection Systems; Monitoring system; Rule-based method; Statistical learning; Supervised algorithm; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,,,"Mirsky, Y., Doitshman, T., Elovici, Y., Shabtai, A., Kitsune: An ensemble of autoencoders for online network intrusion detection (2018) NDSS, 5, p. 2; Casas, P., Mazel, J., Owezarski, P., Unada: Unsupervised network anomaly detection using sub-space outliers ranking (2011) International Conference on Research in Networking, pp. 40-51. , Springer; Ester, M., Kriegel, H.-P., Sander, J., Xu, X., A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise (1996) Kdd, 96 (34), pp. 226-231; Siffer, A., Fouque, P.-A., Termier, A., Largoüet, C., Anomaly detection in streams with extreme value theory (2017) Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Dynamic information flow tracking has been proposed to detect APTs. In this article, we develop a dynamic information flow tracking game for resource-efficient detection of APTs via multistage dynamic games. The game evolves on an information flow graph, whose nodes are processes and objects (e.g., file, network endpoints) in the system and the edges capture the interaction between different processes and objects. Each stage of the game has prespecified targets that are characterized by a set of nodes of the graph. The goal of the APT is to evade detection and reach a target node of each stage. The goal of the defender is to maximize the detection probability while minimizing performance overhead on the system. The resource costs of the players are different and the information structure is asymmetric, resulting in a nonzero-sum imperfect information game. We first calculate the best responses of the players and then compute Nash equilibrium for single-stage attacks. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a correlated equilibrium for the multistage attack case. Finally, we simulate our model and algorithm on real-world nation state attack data obtained from the Refinable Attack INvestigation (RAIN) system. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threats (APTs); information flow tracking; multistage attacks; multistage dynamic game","Game theory; Graph structures; Polynomial approximation; Correlated equilibria; Detection probabilities; Dynamic information flow tracking; Imperfect information games; Information flow graphs; Information structures; Model and algorithms; Polynomial-time algorithms; Flow graphs",,,,,"DARPA FA8650-15-C-7556

Their mechanism of action involves intersystem crossing to triplet excited state followed by formation of singlet oxygen (1O2), which is a highly reactive species and mediates various oxidative processes. The design of advanced sensitizers based on porphyrin compounds have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, it is still difficult to predict the efficiency of singlet oxygen generation for a given structure. Our goal was to develop a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model for the fast virtual screening and prediction of singlet oxygen quantum yields for pophyrins and metalloporphyrins. We performed QSPR analysis of a dataset containing 32 compounds, including various porphyrins and their analogues (chlorins and bacteriochlorins). Quantum-chemical descriptors were calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT), namely B3LYP and M062X functionals. Three different machine learning methods were used to develop QSPR models: random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and multiple linear regression (MLR). The optimal QSPR model «structure – singlet oxygen generation quantum yield» obtained using RFR method demonstrated high determination coefficient for the training set (R2 = 0.949) and the highest predicting ability for the test set (pred_R2 = 0.875). This proves that the developed QSPR method is realiable and can be directly applied in the studies of singlet oxygen generation both for free base porphyrins and their metal complexes. We believe that QSPR approach developed in this study can be useful for the search of new poprhyrin photosensitizers with enhanced singlet oxygen generation ability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Photosensitization; Porphyrins; Quantitative structure-property relationship; Singlet oxygen",,,,,,,,,,"Lacombe, S., Pigota, T., Materials for selective photo-oxygenation vs. photocatalysis: preparation, properties and applications in environmental and health fields (2016) Catal.

However, with tremendous evolution in data acquisition and transfer, a new type of attack represented by advanced persistent threat (APT) has attracted wide attention. APT organization identification for malware is a method to detect APT attacks. However, most of malware is tailored to the goal, it is complex and changeable, or can be updated very quickly. The traditional analysis method is difficult to obtain the source information of APT organization from the malware in the IoT. To this end, we propose a software genes method to solve this problem. Software gene is binary fragment of specific function or information in the software body. In this paper, different from traditional data flow and instruction flow, a new gene model is proposed which combine with knowledge graph of malware behavior. We fill the processed malware information into the gene model to obtain the APT organization gene pool. Of course, the gene pool should be optimized to include the genetic characteristics of APT. In theory, there genetic characteristics can help us identify malware and APT accurately in the IoT. However, biological genetic similarity algorithms cannot be used directly. A genetic similarity algorithm for APT organization identification of malware will be designed instead. Simulations on real-world dataset corroborate theoretical analysis and reveal the possibility of using genes for malware traceability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Bioinformatics; Biology; Data acquisition; Data flow analysis; Flow graphs; Genes; Internet of things; Knowledge representation; Analysis method; Gene model; Gene pools; Genetic characteristics; Genetic similarities; Instruction flow; Knowledge graphs; Malware behaviors; Malware",,,,,"2019B010137004

Attack graphs' topologies can be leveraged to detect, explain and visualize the progress of such attacks. However, due to the abundance of false-positives, such graphs are usually overwhelmingly large and difficult for an analyst to understand. Graph partitioning refers to the problem of reducing the graph of alerts to a set of smaller incidents that are easier for an analyst to process and better represent the actual attack plan. Existing approaches are oblivious to the security-context of the problem at hand and result in graphs which, while smaller, make little sense from a security perspective. In this paper, we propose an optimization approach allowing us to generate security-aware partitions, utilizing aspects such as the kill chain progression, number of assets involved, as well as the size of the graph. Using real-world datasets, the results show that our approach produces graphs that are better at capturing the underlying attack compared to state-of-the-art approaches and are easier for the analyst to understand. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Graph theory; Graphic methods; Enterprise networks; False positive; Graph Partitioning; Multi-step attacks; Optimization approach; Real-world datasets; Security context; State-of-the-art approach; Computer networks",,,,,,,,,"Ghafir, I., Prenosil, V., Advanced persistent threat attack detection: An overview (2014) International Journal of Advances in Computer Networks and Its Security (IJCNS), 4 (4), p. 5054; McWhorter, D., Apt1: Exposing one of China's cyber espionage units (2013) Mandiant, 18; Alvarez, M., Bradley, N., Cobb, P., Craig, S., Iffert, R., Kessem, L., Kravitz, J., Moore, S., IBM x-force threat intelligence index 2017 (2017) IBM Security, pp. 1-30. , March; Berghel, H., Equifax and the latest round of identity theft roulette (2017) Computer, 50 (12), pp. 72-76; Strom, B.E., Applebaum, A., Miller, D.P., Nickels, K.C., Pennington, A.G., Thomas, C.B., Mitre att&ck: Design and philosophy (2018) MITRE Product MP, pp. 18-0944; Cao, P., Badger, E., Kalbarczyk, Z., Iyer, R., Slagell, A., Preemptive intrusion detection: Theoretical framework and real-world measurements (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security, pp. 1-12; Qin, X., (2005) A Probabilistic-based Framework for Infosec Alert Correlation, , Ph.

CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. 'Autonomy' is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments. © 2020 IEEE.","autonomy; BVLOS; command-and-control; test and evaluation; unmanned systems; UXS","Ability testing; Antennas; Automobile manufacture; Behavioral research; Command and control systems; Control theory; Data transfer; Decision making; End effectors; Highway engineering; Navigation; Oceanography; Satellite communication systems; Surface testing; Visual servoing; Autonomous operations; Capabilities-based assessments; Command and control (C2); Communication architectures; Environmental Monitoring; Operational performance; Satellite communications; Terrestrial communication; Autonomous underwater vehicles",,,,,,,,,"Ahner, D.A., Workshop report: Test and evaluation of autonomous systems (2016) Wright Patterson AFB, OH: Scientific Test & Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence; Federal, C., (2020), https://cherokeefederal.com/unmanned-systems, August.

Its hydrogen-terminated surface, in conjunction with a suitable surface acceptor, develops a two-dimensional (2D) p-type surface conductivity through the surface transfer doping mechanism which can then be harvested for constructing functional devices. In this study, we have revisited the surface transfer doping of diamond by a high electron affinity (EA) transition metal oxide, V2O5. Through a combination of in-situ electrical measurements, Hall effect measurements and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explicitly show the intrinsic surface transfer doping behavior of V2O5, with doping performance superior to other competing TMOs such as MoO3. The metallic surface conduction of diamond induced by V2O5 is persistent down to 250 mK; this when coupled with the high hole density exceeding 7 × 1013 cm−2 offers a promising platform for the development of advanced diamond surface electronics exploiting many interesting quantum transport properties of the 2D hole layer of diamond. © 2020","DFT; Hydrogen-terminated diamond; Surface transfer doping; Vanadium pentoxide","Calculations; Diamonds; Electron affinity; Hydrogen; Molybdenum oxide; Quantum chemistry; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Vanadium pentoxide; Carbon-based electronics; First principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations; Hall effect measurement; High electron affinities; Hydrogen-terminated diamond; Hydrogen-terminated surfaces; Quantum transport properties; Surface transfer doping; Density functional theory",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP150101673, FT160100207

Framed on the theory of conditional convergence, changes in convergence speeds´ are analyzed under the hypothesis of conditional convergence in clubs. There are two municipal groups of analysis based on regional inequalities: the first, the advanced group with a reduced number of municipalities, high speed of convergence and sensitive to investment shocks; and the second, a backward group with a large number of municipalities, reduced convergence speed and less sensitive to investment shocks, especially concerning human capital. The result suggests that a national policy to encourage investment in reproducible capital with excluding different realities of production may increase economic inequalities among municipalities in countries with robust inequality, such as Brazil. © 2020, Universidade de Taubate.

This raised public awareness about the possibility of similar attacks against other industrial targets-including critical infrastructure. In this article, we use hypergames to analyze how strategic perturbations of sensor readings and calibrated parameters can be used to manipulate a system that employs optimal control. Hypergames form an extension of game theory that enables us to model strategic interactions where the players may have significantly different perceptions of the game(s) they are playing. Past work with hypergames has focused on relatively simple interactions consisting of a small set of discrete choices for each player. Here, we apply single-stage hypergames to larger systems with continuous variables. We find that manipulating constraints can be a more effective attacker strategy than manipulating objective function parameters. Moreover, the attacker need not change the underlying system to carry out a successful attack-it may be sufficient to deceive the defender controlling the system. It is possible to scale our approach up to even larger systems, but this will depend on the characteristics of the system in question, and we identify several characteristics that will make those systems amenable to hypergame analysis. © 2020 ACM.","advanced persistent threats; Cyber-physical security; game theory; optimal control","Cyber Physical System; Game theory; Security of data; Continuous variables; Cyber-Physical securities; Hypergame analysis; Industrial control systems; Objective functions; Public awareness; Strategic interactions; Underlying systems; Control systems",,,,,,"This work was supported by the DOE EERE Building Technologies Office, Sensors and Controls program.

However, research efforts focused on the effective remediation of antibiotic-polluted soil are still very limited. In this study, a nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (nsp-DBD) plasma system was used for the first time to remediate soil contaminated by ciprofloxacin which is one of the most widely used, persistent and genotoxic antibiotics. Various cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) operating parameters were investigated and optimized. The optimal moisture content and air flow rate were determined at 5% and 1.0 L min−1, respectively. Ciprofloxacin degradation increased with pulse voltage and pulse repetition rate and decreased with higher initial concentrations in the soil. At optimal conditions (pulse voltage 17.4 kV, pulse frequency 200 Hz), ciprofloxacin was completely degraded (~99%) in soil, at very short nsp-DBD treatment time (~3 min), with the corresponding energy efficiency being 4.6 mg/kJ. The relative distribution and identity of major ciprofloxacin degradants generated was determined by UPLC-MS analysis. This led to the generation of a degradation map that is consistent with hydroxyl radical-driven successive hydrogen atom abstractions and hydroxyl radical recombination events at the onset of the process followed by singlet oxygen mediated degradation. Interestingly, the degradation pattern observed under nsp-DBD conditions shares several aspects with the in-vivo metabolic profile of ciprofloxacin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced oxidation processes; Antibiotics; Ciprofloxacin; Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP); Nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (nsp-DBD); Soil remediation","Antibiotics; Atoms; Degradation; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Energy efficiency; Flow control; Health risks; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma theory; Pulse repetition rate; Remediation; Soil conservation; Soil quality; Water quality; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Ciprofloxacin; Cold atmospheric plasmas; Pulsed dielectric barrier discharges; Soil remediation; Soil pollution",,,,,"General Secretariat for Research and Technology, GSRT: [1754

In this paper, we introduce a new game-theoretic framework of the interaction between a defender who uses limited Security Resources(SRs) to harden network and an attacker who adopts a multi-stage plan to attack the network. The game model is derived from Stackelberg games called a Multi-stage Maze Network Game (M2NG) in which the characteristics of APT are fully considered. The possible plans of the attacker are compactly represented using attack graphs(AGs), but the compact representation of the attacker's strategies presents a computational challenge and reaching the Nash Equilibrium(NE) is NP-hard. We present a method that first translates AGs into Markov Decision Process(MDP) and then achieves the optimal SRs allocation using the policy hill-climbing(PHC) algorithm. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of the model and analyze the scalability and sensitivity of the algorithm. Simulation results exhibit that our proposed reinforcement learning-based SRs allocation is feasible and efficient. © 2020 IEEE.","Advanced Persistent Threat; attack graphs; policy hill-climbing; reinforcement learning (RL); Stackelberg games","Computer crime; Game theory; Markov processes; NP-hard; Optimization; Privacy by design; Reinforcement learning; Compact representation; Computational challenges; Empirical evaluations; Markov Decision Processes; Optimal networks; Privacy leakages; Security hardening; Stackelberg Games; Network security",,,,,,,,,"Tankard, C., Advanced persistent threats and how to monitor and deter them (2011) Network Security, 2011 (8), pp. 16-19; Zhu, Q., Rass, S., Game theory meets network security: A tutorial (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 2163-2165; Li, Y., Dai, W., Bai, J., Gan, X., Wang, J., Wang, X., An intelligence-driven security-aware defense mechanism for advanced persistent threats (2018) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 14 (3), pp. 646-661; Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., Flipit: The game of stealthy takeover (2013) Journal of Cryptology, 26 (4), pp. 655-713; Zhang, M., Zheng, Z., Shroff, N.B., A game theoretic model for defending against stealthy attacks with limited resources (2015) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security, pp. 93-112. , Springer; Durkota, K., Lisỳ, V., Bosanskỳ, B., Kiekintveld, C., Optimal network security hardening using attack graph games (2015) Twenty-Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Ou, X., Govindavajhala, S., Appel, A.W., Mulval: A logic-based network security analyzer (2005) USENIX Security Symposium, 8, pp. 113-128. , Baltimore, MD; Sheyner, O., Haines, J., Jha, S., Lippmann, R., Wing, J.M., Automated generation and analysis of attack graphs (2002) Proceedings 2002 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 273-284; Noel, S., Jajodia, S., Optimal ids sensor placement and alert prioritization using attack graphs (2008) Journal of Network and Systems Management, 16 (3), pp. 259-275; Noel, S., Jajodia, S., Wang, L., Singhal, A., Measuring security risk of networks using attack graphs (2010) International Journal of Next-Generation Computing, 1 (1), pp. 135-147; Homer, J., Zhang, S., Ou, X., Schmidt, D., Du, Y., Raj Rajagopalan, S., Singhal, A., Aggregating vulnerability metrics in enterprise networks using attack graphs (2013) Journal of Computer Security, 21 (4), pp. 561-597; Greiner, R., Hayward, R., Jankowska, M., Molloy, M., Finding optimal satisficing strategies for and-or trees (2006) Artificial Intelligence, 170 (1), pp. 19-58; Min, M., Xiao, L., Xie, C., Hajimirsadeghi, M., Mandayam, N.B., Defense against advanced persistent threats: A colonel blotto game approach (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 1-6; Min, M., Xiao, L., Xie, C., Hajimirsadeghi, M., Mandayam, N.B., Defense against advanced persistent threats in dynamic cloud storage: A colonel blotto game approach (2018) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5 (6), pp. 4250-4261; Tambe, M., (2011) Security and Game Theory: Algorithms, Deployed Systems, Lessons Learned, , Cambridge university press; Bellman, R., Dynamic programming and lagrange multipliers (1956) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 42 (10), p. 767",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2020 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, ISCC 2020","7 July 2020 through 10 July 2020",,164026,15301346,9781728180861,,,"English","Proc.

To take away this asymmetric advantage, Moving Target Defense (MTD) continuously shifts the configuration of the underlying system, in turn reducing the success rate of cyberattacks. In this survey, we analyze the recent advancements made in the development of MTDs and highlight (1) how these defenses can be defined using common terminology, (2) can be made more effective with the use of artificial intelligence techniques for decision making, (3) be implemented in practice and (4) evaluated. We first define an MTD using a simple and yet general notation that captures the key aspects of such defenses. We then categorize these defenses into different sub-classes depending on what they move, when they move and how they move. In trying to answer the latter question, we showcase the use of domain knowledge and game-theoretic modeling can help the defender come up with effective and efficient movement strategies. Second, to understand the practicality of these defense methods, we discuss how various MTDs have been implemented and find that networking technologies such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization act as key enablers for implementing these dynamic defenses. We then briefly highlight MTD test-beds and case-studies to aid readers who want to examine or deploy existing MTD techniques. Third, our survey categorizes proposed MTDs based on the qualitative and quantitative metrics they utilize to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of security and performance. We use well-defined metrics such as risk analysis and performance costs for qualitative evaluation and metrics based on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA), attack representation, QoS impact, and targeted threat models for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we show that our categorization of MTDs is effective in identifying novel research areas and highlight directions for future research. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","advanced persistent threats; artificial intelligence; attack representation methods (ARMs); cyber deception; cyber kill chain (CKC); Cyber security; game theory; moving target defense; network function virtualization (NFV); network security; QoS metrics; qualitative metrics; quantitative metrics; risk analysis; software-defined networking (SDN)","Decision making; Game theory; Network function virtualization; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Surveys; Artificial intelligence techniques; Game-theoretic model; Moving target defense; Networking technology; Qualitative evaluations; Quantitative evaluation; Quantitative metrics; Security and performance; Network security",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1723440, 61571375, 61628201, DGE-1723440, OAC-1642031, SaTC-1528099

This balance is underestimated when programmes and services seek inspiration and guidance from global trends without adequate attention to local reality. Poverty is treated as a failure of the people (and by the people as a failure of the Government) rather than a consequence of long-standing structural marginalization. Blaming the victim has been an important theme in evaluating cultural practices of people living with disadvantage. This is a serious error in judgement both on scientific and ethical grounds. Despite enduring scholarly work that recognizes the need for context-sensitive theory and research in the field of psychology, institutional practices have remained largely loyal to global trends. Large-scale intervention programmes in community welfare persist with practices that derive directly from mainstream psychology, especially in the fields of education, family studies and child development. Through the financial and ideological push from international NGOs that prescribe objectives and strategies for intervention, the real problem remains ignored despite claiming impressive outreach. Primarily because of misplaced emphases and misconstrued priorities, intervention initiatives often fail to meet the objectives of social justice and equity. Furthermore, they may even result in distancing people in marginalized communities further, on account of unintended consequences of welfare activity. This can be seen in the large number of youth that hang precariously in between the world that they knew and the one that was implicitly promised to them. In spite of claims about coverage in terms of numbers, providing ecologically valid, cultural relevant and socially just services is restricted to a handful of committed agencies. This article will focus on specific instances of educational and welfare programmes that are advanced without either the knowledge about or respect for local community ideology in the desire to bring about social change for their “upliftment”. A special case in point is the persistent inability for the poor to access and participate in good quality education despite their enthusiasm and motivation. After providing an overview of the ideological mismatch between local culture and global policy, I will also give examples of experiments that have been successful in working towards ethically and scientifically sound welfare initiatives. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Children’s rights; Cultural differences; Ethics; International NGOs; Intervention; Poverty; Welfare",,,,,,,,,,"Adichie, C., The danger of a single story (2009) TED Talks, , https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story/transcript?language=en, Accessed 15 Dec 2018; Arnett, J., The neglected 95%: why American psychology needs to become less American (2008) American Psychologist, 63 (7), pp. 602-614; Attiah, K., (2014); Bhatia, S., (2018) Decolonising psychology: globalisation, social justice and youth identities, , Oxford University Press, New York; Burman, E., Local, global or globalized?

Firstly, this paper analyzed the attack paths of attackers and proposed the defensive framework of network security by analyzing the characteristics of the APT attack and the distributed network structure. Secondly, OAPG(an attack path prediction model oriented to APT) was established from the value both the attacker and the defender based on game theory, besides, this paper calculated the game equilibrium and generated the maximum revenue path of the attacker, and then put forward the best defensive strategy for defender. Finally, this paper validated the model by an instance of APT attack, the calculated results showed that the model can analyze the attacker and defender from the attack path, and can provide a reasonable defense scheme for organizations that use distributed networks. © 2020 IEEE.","APT attack; game model; network defense framework","Game theory; Attack path; Defensive strategies; Distributed network structures; Distributed networks; Game equilibrium; Game models; Maximum revenue; Problem-based; Network security",,,,,,,,,"Baldonado, R.S., Zhu, Q., Gadapt: A sequential game-theoretic framework for designing defense-in-depth strategies against advanced persistent threats[c] (2016) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security, pp. 314-326. , Springer International Publishing; Cutler, T., The anatomy of an advanced persistent threat[j] (2010) Wired Business Media [Database Online]; Feng, X., Zheng, Z., Hu, P., Stealthy attacks meets insider threats: A threeplayer game model[c] (2015) Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2015-2015 IEEE.

Herein, we demonstrate single iron atoms confined in MoS2 nanosheets with dual catalytic sites and synergistic catalysis as highly reactive and stable catalysts for efficient catalytic oxidation of recalcitrant organic pollutants via activation of PS. The dual reaction sites and the interaction between Fe and Mo greatly enhance the catalytic performance for PS activation. The radical scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance results confirm and SO4[rad]− rather than HO[rad] is responsible for aniline degradation. The high catalytic performance of Fe0.36Mo0.64S2 was interpreted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations via strong metal-support interactions and the low formal oxidation state of Fe in FexMo1-xS2. FexMo1-xS2/PS system can effectively remove various persistent organic pollutants and works well in a real water environment. Also, FexMo1-xS2 can efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate, sulfite and H2O2, suggesting its potential practical applications under various circumstances. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced oxidation process; Co-catalysis; Persulfate activation; Single-atom catalyst","Aniline; Atoms; Catalysis; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical activation; Cobalt compounds; Density functional theory; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Organic pollutants; Oxidation; Paramagnetic resonance; Sulfur compounds; Water pollution; Water treatment; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Catalytic performance; High catalytic performance; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persulfate activations; Recalcitrant organic pollutants; Single atoms; Strong metal support interaction; Iron; aniline; inorganic salt; iron; molybdenum disulfide; persulfate; scavenger; unclassified drug; catalysis; electron spin resonance; hydroxide; nanoparticle; oxidation; radical; scavenger; sulfite; synergism; Article; catalysis; catalyst; degradation; density functional theory; electron spin resonance; electron transport; Fenton reaction; mineralization; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; persistent organic pollutant; total organic carbon; water treatment",,"aniline, 142-04-1, 62-53-3; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41807188, 51508423, 51978537

They play a critical role in the survival of our postmodern economies, as all other areas depend on their availability. An interruption in their operation may have a direct impact on the availability of other services (e.g., health, transportation). The problem is particularly intense when no backup networks are available, or the required recovery time is beyond backup autonomy. The transition to a decentralized management and control system for these networks requires digital technologies, advanced interconnected system communications, and Internet access. These technologies expose critical infrastructure networks to external threats that require careful assessment of cyber-security risks and appropriate countermeasures. An important factor that enhances the range of threats is the heterogeneity of Smart Grids, which incorporate industrial control systems such as the SCADA, distributed control system, and programmable logic controllers to which security improvements may not have been made since they were installed. Υet, another serious problem arises from the fact that older technologies were designed at times when cyber-security was not part of their technical design specifications. At the same time, it should be seriously considered that many of the systems of these networks that can be cyber-attacked may not be easily disconnected, as this could potentially lead to generalized operational problems. In this scientific research, a sophisticated active security framework is proposed, which is based solely on advanced computational intelligence methods and concerns the digital security of critical infrastructure networks. Specifically, this research introduces a sophisticated adaptive ensemble classification framework for real-time data streams by distributed control systems. It is a “Kappa” architecture framework that is based on a two-step online ensemble learning model based on bagging and boosting methods.

This study aims at investigating the dynamics of disease conferring temporary or waning immunity with several forced-control policies aided by vaccination game theory. Considering an infinite and well-mixed homogenous population, our proposed model further illustrates the significance of introducing two well-known forced control techniques, namely, quarantine and isolation, in order to model the dynamics of an infectious disease that spreads within a human population where pre-emptive vaccination has partially been taken before the epidemic season begins. Moreover, we carefully examine the combined effects of these two types (pre-emptive and forced) of protecting measures using the SEIR-type epidemic model. An in-depth investigation based on evolutionary game theory numerically quantifies the weighing impact of individuals' vaccinating decisions to improve the efficacy of forced control policies leading up to the relaxation of the epidemic spreading severity. A deterministic SVEIR model, including vaccinated (V) and exposed (E) states, is proposed having no spatial structure while implementing these intervention techniques. This study uses a mixed control strategy relying on quarantine and isolation policies to quantify the optimum requirement of vaccines for eradicating disease prevalence completely from human societies. Furthermore, our theoretical study justifies the fact that adopting forced control policies significantly reduces the required level of vaccination to suppress emerging disease prevalence, and it also confirms that the joint policy works even better when the epidemic outbreak takes place at a higher transmission rate. Research reveals that the isolation policy is a better disease attenuation tool than the quarantine policy, especially in endemic regions where the disease progression rate is relatively higher. However, a meager progression rate gradually weakens the speed of an epidemic outbreak and, therefore, applying a moderate level of control policies is sufficient to restore the disease-free state. Essentially, positive measures (pre-emptive vaccination) regulate the position of the critical line between two phases, whereas exposed provisions (quarantine or isolation) are rather dedicated to mitigating the disease spreading in endemic regions. Thus, an optimal interplay between these two types of intervention techniques works remarkably well in attenuating the epidemic size. Despite having advanced on the development of new vaccines and control strategies to mitigate epidemics, many diseases like measles, tuberculosis, Ebola, and flu are still persistent. Here, we present a dynamic analysis of the SVEIR model using mean-field theory to develop a simple but efficient strategy for epidemic control based on the simultaneous application of the quarantine and isolation policies. Highlights • This model incorporates the elements of mathematical epidemiology and a vaccination game into a single framework. • A dynamical analysis of the SEIR/V epidemic model equipped with quarantine and isolation policies is introduced. • The proposed game-theoretic framework rigorously addresses real situations when control policies are adopted simultaneously as well as separately. • Adopting control policies can significantly reduce the required level of vaccination to suppress disease prevalence. • A joint policy seems impressive when an epidemic outbreak takes place at a higher transmission rate. • For a smaller basic reproduction number, the quarantine policy outperforms the isolation policy. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","Epidemic modelling; evolution models; evolutionary processes",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: 19KK0262",,,,"Alam, M., Kuga, K., Tanimoto, J., Three-strategy and four-strategy model of vaccination game introducing an intermediate protecting measure (2019) Appl.

High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are exceptional astrophysical laboratories that offer a rare glimpse into the physical processes that govern accretion on compact objects, massive-star winds, and stellar evolution. In a subset of the HMXBs, the compact objects accrete matter solely from winds of massive donor stars. These so-called wind-fed HMXBs are divided in persistent (classical) HMXBs and supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) according to their X-ray properties. While it has been suggested that this dichotomy depends on the characteristics of stellar winds, they have been poorly studied. Aims. With this investigation, we aim to remedy this situation by systematically analyzing donor stars of wind-fed HMXBs that are observable in the UV, concentrating on those with neutron star (NS) companions. Methods. We obtained Swift X-ray data, HST UV spectra, and additional optical spectra for all our targets. The spectral analysis of our program stars was carried out with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model atmosphere code. Results. Our multi-wavelength approach allows us to provide stellar and wind parameters for six donor stars (four wind-fed systems and two OBe X-ray binaries). The wind properties are in line with the predictions of the line-driven wind theory. Based on the abundances, three of the donor stars are in an advanced evolutionary stage, while for some of the stars, the abundance pattern indicates that processed material might have been accreted. When passing by the NS in its tight orbit, the donor star wind has not yet reached its terminal velocity but it is still significantly slower; its speed is comparable with the orbital velocity of the NS companion. There are no systematic differences between the two types of wind-fed HMXBs (persistent versus transients) with respect to the donor stars. For the SFXTs in our sample, the orbital eccentricity is decisive for their transient X-ray nature. The dichotomy of wind-fed HMXBs studied in this work is primarily a result of the orbital configuration, while in general it is likely that it reflects a complex interplay between the donor-star parameters, the orbital configuration, and the NS properties. Based on the orbital parameters and the further evolution of the donor stars, the investigated HMXBs will presumably form Thorne-Zytkow objects in the future. © ESO 2020.","Binaries: close; Stars: atmospheres; Stars: early-type; Stars: mass-loss; Stars: winds, outflows; X-rays: binaries","Beryllium compounds; Spectrum analysis; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Wind; X rays; Evolutionary stage; High mass X ray binaries; Orbital configuration; Orbital eccentricity; Orbital parameters; Orbital velocities; Processed materials; Stellar evolutions; Stars",,,,,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAS 5-26555

However, the discovery of LPPs is thus far largely the results of trial and error. Here, theory-guided defect tuning through topochemical reactions is demonstrated for accelerated discovery of emerging LPPs. First-principles calculations are employed to identify the thermodynamic charge-transition levels of different defect states, which help examine whether the candidate structure is a suitable host for afterglow. Rationally tuning the species and concentrations of defects through topochemical reactions is then illustrated, which leads to discovery of Pr3+-doped LaPO4 featuring ultraviolet C afterglow with a lasting time of over 2 h. Such a strategy, in conjunction with advanced characterizations including high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance, suggests a radical-involved afterglow mechanism. Importantly, it is illustrated that this concept can be extended for the discovery of more LPPs. It is suggested that theory-guided defect engineering enabled by topochemical reactions can be used as a powerful tool to accelerate discovery of novel LPPs with much clearer afterglow mechanisms, with implications even for the design of other optoelectronic materials. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Theories are continually being formulated, criticized, and reformulated as theorists attempt to settle this issue. However, there yet remains no general consensus as to whether any theory successfully answers this question in either the affirmative or the negative. I propose the legal doctrine of quasi-contract as a candidate for making sense of this persistent issue. While the duty to reciprocate and the principle of reasonable expectations each falls short when independently advanced as a theory of political obligation, quasi-contract, which combines reciprocity, reasonable expectations, and additional moral considerations, is able to establish a satisfactory account of political obligation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hunter, C.O.United States; email: cameron.oren.hunter@gmail.com",,,"Springer",,,,,01675249,,,,"English","Law Philos.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075244056

Proactive dynamic defenses provide a strategic and holistic security mechanism to increase the costs of attacks and mitigate the risks. This work proposes a dynamic game framework to model a long-term interaction between a stealthy attacker and a proactive defender. The stealthy and deceptive behaviors are captured by the multi-stage game of incomplete information, where each player has his own private information unknown to the other. Both players act strategically according to their beliefs which are formed by the multi-stage observation and learning. The perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium provides a useful prediction of both players’ policies because no players benefit from unilateral deviations from the equilibrium. We propose an iterative algorithm to compute the perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium and use the Tennessee Eastman process as a benchmark case study. Our numerical experiment corroborates the analytical results and provides further insights into the design of proactive defense-in-depth strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber deception; Defense in depth; Industrial control system security; Multi-stage Bayesian game; Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium; Proactive defense; Tennessee Eastman process","Computation theory; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Game theory; Iterative methods; Network security; Advanced persistent threats; Bayesian game; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Cyber deception; Defense in depth; Industrial control systems; Proactive defense; Tennessee Eastman process; Dynamics",,,,,"CGS

It is present in various types of distribution networks, as leak in pipe networks or as high-impedance fault in electric systems. As smart meters come into general use, distribution systems are upgraded to have advanced metering infrastructure which can be used for diagnostic purposes. Different kind of detection methods are presented in different physical domains therefore comparison is cumbersome. The main achievement of the presented work is the formulation of an abstract system description, in order to tackle problems from various domains on a common ground. The notions of the well established general network theory are being used as a solid foundation. In this framework a general extension of flow networks is presented for distribution systems with measurement data available. Detecting faults at metered points is tackled in the literature, this problem is translated into the proposed representation. On the other hand a novel problem is described, the fault at unknown location between two metered points. The applicability of the abstract description to specialized distribution systems is presented through a simple case study.

Achieving perfect security for IoT networks is often cost-prohibitive if not impossible. Cyber insurance is a valuable mechanism to mitigate cyber risks for IoT systems. In this work, we propose a bi-level game-theoretic framework called FlipIn to design incentivecompatible and welfare-maximizing cyber insurance contracts. The framework captures the strategic interactions among APT attackers, IoT defenders, and cyber insurance insurers, and incorporates influence networks to assess the systemic cyber risks of interconnected IoT devices. The FlipIn framework formulates a game over networks within a principal-agent problem of moral-hazard type to design a cyber risk-aware insurance contract. We completely characterize the equilibrium solutions of the bi-level games for a network of distributed defenders and a semi-homogeneous centralized defender and show that the optimal insurance contracts cover half of the defenders' losses. Our framework predicts the risk compensation of defenders and the Peltzman effect of insurance. We study a centralized security management scenario and its decentralized counterpart, and leverage numerical experiments to show that network connectivity plays an important role in the security of the IoT devices and the insurability of both distributed and centralized defenders. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

Due to the stealthy and persistent nature of the lateral movement, defenders need to consider time and spatial locations holistically to discover latent attack paths across a large time-scale and achieve long-term security for the target assets. In this work, we propose a time-expanded random network to model the stochastic service links in the user-host enterprise network and the adversarial lateral movement. We design cognitive honeypots at idle production nodes and disguise honey links as service links to detect and deter the adversarial lateral movement. The location of the honeypot changes randomly at different times and increases the honeypots’ stealthiness. Since the defender does not know whether, when, and where the initial intrusion and the lateral movement occur, the honeypot policy aims to reduce the target assets’ Long-Term Vulnerability (LTV) for proactive and persistent protection. We further characterize three tradeoffs, i.e., the probability of interference, the stealthiness level, and the roaming cost. To counter the curse of multiple attack paths, we propose an iterative algorithm and approximate the LTV with the union bound for computationally efficient deployment of cognitive honeypots. The results of the vulnerability analysis illustrate the bounds, trends, and a residue of LTV when the adversarial lateral movement has infinite duration. Besides honeypot policies, we obtain a critical threshold of compromisability to guide the design and modification of the current system parameters for a higher level of long-term security.

Nowadays, DGA is an evasive technique used by many of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups and Botnets to bypass host and network-level detection mechanisms. Legacy malware developers used to hard code the IP address of control and command server in malware payload. But, this led to identifying malicious IP address by reverse engineering the malware payload. Drawbacks in this hardcoding IP mechanism led to the idea of character-based Domain Generation Algorithms, where attackers generate a list of domain names using traditional cryptographic principles of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). Recent advances in malware research, machine learning address this problem to a large extent. Lately, malware developers came up with a new variant of DGA called word-list based DGA. In this approach, the malware uses a set of words from the dictionary to construct meaningful substrings that resembles real domain names. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting Word-list based DGA domain names using ensemble approaches with 15 features (both lexical and network-level). Added to this, we generated syntactic data using CTGAN (GAN-based data synthesizer that can generate synthetic data) to measure the robustness of our model. In our experiment, C5.0 stands out as the best with prediction accuracy of 0.9503 and out of 30000 synthetically generated malicious domains names, 1351 classified as benign. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","APT; DGA; Diffusion map; GAN; Malware; PCA","Cryptography; Internet protocols; Network security; Number theory; Random number generation; Reverse engineering; Data synthesizers; Ensemble approaches; Ensemble models; Generation algorithm; Network level; Prediction accuracy; Pseudo random number generators; Synthetic data; Malware",,,,,,,,,"Chen, X., Towards an understanding of anti-virtualization and anti-debugging behavior in modern malware (2008) IEEE International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks with FTCS and DCC (DSN), pp. 177-186. , IEEE; Sai Charan, P.V., Gireesh Kumar, T., Mohan Anand, P., Advance persistent threat detection using long short term memory (LSTM) neural networks (2019) ICETCE 2019.

Since the conventional detection and repair (DAR)-based APT defense mechanism has several conspicuous drawbacks, it is imperative to develop a more effective and efficient APT defense mechanism. Based on the data backup and recovery (DBAR) techniques developed in the field of disaster recovery, we propose a novel APT defense mechanism referred to as DBAR-based APT defense mechanism, which can overcome the main drawbacks of the DAR-based APT defense mechanism and is expected to be implementable efficiently in the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm. Under the new mechanism, we study the problem of finding a cost-effective DBAR strategy. Based on a novel dynamic model characterizing the evolution of the expected security status of the organizational network, we reduce the problem to a differential game-theoretic problem, which is aimed to seek a cost-effective DBAR strategy in terms of the Nash equilibrium solution concept. Next, we derive the optimality system of the problem. Extensive comparative experiments show that the DBAR strategy obtained from the optimality system is cost-effective in the sense of Nash equilibrium solution concept.

Among the tools used by cybercriminals, malicious domains are indispensable and harm from the Internet has become a global problem. Malicious domains play an important role from SPAM and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) threats to Botnet and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks at large scales. To ensure there is not a single point of failure or to prevent their detection and blocking, malware authors have employed domain generation algorithms (DGAs) and domain-flux techniques to generate a large number of domain names for malicious servers. As a result, malicious servers are difficult to detect and remove. Furthermore, the clues of cybercrime are stored in network traffic logs, but analyzing long-term big network traffic data is a challenge. To adapt the technology of cybercrimes and automatically detect unknown malicious threats, we previously proposed a system called MD-Miner. To improve its efficiency and accuracy, we propose the MD-MinerP here, which generates more features with identification capabilities in the feature extraction stage. Moreover, MD-MinerP adapts interaction profiling bipartite graphs instead of annotated bipartite graphs. The experimental results show that MD-MinerP has better area under curve (AUC) results and found new malicious domains that could not be recognized by other threat intelligence systems. The MD-MinerP exhibits both scalability and applicability, which has been experimentally validated on actual enterprise network traffic. © 2020 Tzung-Han Jeng et al.",,"Graph theory; Bipartite graphs; Control domains; Cross-site scripting; Enterprise networks; Generation algorithm; Intelligence systems; Its efficiencies; Network traffic; Malware",,,,,,,,,"Sharif, M., Lanzi, A., Giffin, J., Lee, W., Impeding malware analysis using conditional code obfuscation (2008) Proceedings of the 15th An Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS'08), , Feburary, San Diego, CA, USA; Oberheide, J., Cooke, E., Jahanian, F., CloudAV: N-version antivirus in the network cloud (2008) Proceedings of the 17th An Security Symposium, pp. 91-106. , July, Boston, MA, USA; Seewald, A.K., Gansterer, W.N., On the detection and identification of botnets (2010) Computers & Security, 29 (1), pp. 45-58. , 2-s2.0-71649087916; Gu, G., Zhang, J., Lee, W., Botsniffer, Detecting botnet command and control channels in network traffic (2008) Proceedings of the 15th An Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS'08), , Feburary, San Diego, CA, USA; Gu, G., Perdisci, R., Zhang, J., Lee, W., BotMiner: Clustering analysis of network traffic for protocol- And structure-independent botnet detection (2008) Proceedings of the 17th An USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security '08), pp. 139-154. , August, Boston, MA, USA; Wurzinger, P., Bilge, L., Holz, T., Goebel, J., Kruegel, C., Kir-Da, E., Automatically generating models for botnet detection (2009) Proceedings of the 14th An European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESOR-ICS'09), pp. 232-249. , September, Saint-Malo, France 2-s2.0-70350374367; Binsalleeh, H., Ormerod, T., Boukhtouta, A., On the analysis of the Zeus botnet crimeware toolkit (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 Eighth International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust, pp. 31-38. , August, Ottawa, Canada 2-s2.0-78549259165; Francois, J., Wang, S., Bronzi, W., State, R., Engel, T., Botcloud: Detecting Botnets Using MapReduce (2011) Proceedings of the IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS'11), pp. 1-6. , December, Delft, The Netherlands 2-s2.0-84863031076; Strayer, W.T., Walsh, R., Livadas, C., Lapsley, D., Detecting botnets with tight command and control (2006) Proceedings of the 31th An.

This makes mandatory to develop advanced security services beyond traditional solutions, being Opinion Dynamics one of them. This novel approach proposes a multi-agent collaborative framework that permits to trace an APT throughout its entire life-cycle, as formerly analyzed. In this paper, we introduce TI&TO, a two-player game between an attacker and defender that represents a realistic scenario where both compete for the control of the resources within a modern industrial architecture. By validating this technique using game theory, we demonstrate that Opinion Dynamics consists in an effective first measure to deter and minimize the impact of an APT against the infrastructure in most cases. To achieve this, both attacker and defense models are formalized and an equitable score system is applied, to latter run several simulation test cases with different strategies and network configurations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced Persistent Threat; Defense; Detection; Game theory; Opinion Dynamics; Response","Cryptography; Ecosystems; Game theory; Life cycle; Multi agent systems; Collaborative framework; Entire life cycles; Industrial architecture; Industrial ecosystems; Network configuration; Opinion dynamics; Realistic scenario; Security services; Network security",,,,,"777996

Their existence and interplay forms a vital pillar of contemporary societies, and their protection is a top duty of governments and security research. Recent years have shown a paradigm shift of cyber-attacks from specific individual threat and attack scenarios, to a modern combination of various attack types and strategies to what we call an advanced persistent threat (APT) today. This term describes a diverse class of attacks that all share a set of common characteristics, which presents new challenges to security that demand urgent and continuous action by practitioners, researchers and every stakeholder of a critical infrastructure. The main focus of the book is describing game theory as a tool to establish security against APTs, and to this end, the introduction here starts with the abstract characteristics of an APT, showcasing them with a set of selected real-life documented cases of APTs that ends the chapter. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,,"Assante, MJ, Lee, RM, (2015) The Industrial Control System Cyber Kill Chain, , https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/ICS/industrial-control-system-cyber-kill-chain-36297, SANS White Paper, SANS, Bethesda; (2016) IT-Grundschutz Catalogue, , https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html, Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik BSI, Bonn.

Therefore, this study proposed a research model to investigate the impact of BDA on perceived sales performance in accordance with the resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability theory. The 416 valid responses collected from the employees of pharmaceutical organizations were analyzed using structural equation modelling to test the proposed research model. Results indicated that the BDA and customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities shared a strong positive impact on perceived sales performance. BDA, as organizational resources, creates organizational dynamic capabilities, such as CRM capabilities. BDA and CRM capabilities can influence perceived sales performance. Furthermore, CRM capabilities have a significant mediating impact on the relationships between BDA and perceived sales performance. This study also highlighted the practical and theoretical implications of the proposed model, the research limitations, and the future research directions. © 2020 Muhammad Shahbaz et al.",,"Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Enterprise resource management; Public relations; Customer relationship management; Dynamic capabilities; Future research directions; Organizational dynamic capabilities; Pharmaceutical organization; Resource-based view; Sales performance; Structural equation modelling; Sales",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71672050, 71774044","(is study was supported by the NSFC “National Natural Science Foundation of China” under project numbers “71672050” and “71774044”.",,,"Mikalef, P., Pappas, I.O., Krogstie, J., Giannakos, M., Big data analytics capabilities: A systematic literature review and research agenda (2018) Information Systems and E-Business Management, 16 (3), pp. 547-578; Li, H., Wu, J., Liu, L., Li, Q., Adoption of big data analytics in Healthcare: The efficiency and privacy (2015) Proceedings of the Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, , Singapore, July; Nguyen, T., Zhou, L., Spiegler, V., Ieromonachou, P., Lin, Y., Big data analytics in supply chain management: A state-of-the-art literature review (2018) Computers & Operations Research, 98, pp. 254-264; Hariri, R.H., Fredericks, E.M., Bowers, K.M., Uncertainty in big data analytics: Survey, opportunities, and challenges (2019) Journal of Big Data, 6 (1); Manyika, J., Chui, M., Brown, B., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, p. 156. , McKinsey Global Institute, New York, NY, USA; John Walker, S., Big data: A revolution that will transform how we live, work, and think (2014) International Journal of Advertising, 33 (1), pp. 181-183; Wamba, S.F., Gunasekaran, A., Akter, S., Ren, S.J.-F., Dubey, R., Childe, S.J., Big data analytics and firm performance: Effects of dynamic capabilities (2017) Journal of Business Research, 70, pp. 356-365; Shahbaz, M., Gao, C., Zhai, L., Shahzad, F., Hu, Y., Investigating the adoption of big data analytics in healthcare: The moderating role of resistance to change (2019) Journal of Big Data, 6 (1), pp. 1-20; Boone, T., Ganeshan, R., Jain, A., Sanders, N.R., Forecasting sales in the supply chain: Consumer analytics in the big data era (2019) International Journal of Forecasting, 35 (1), pp. 170-180; Davenport, T.H., Analytics 3.0-in the new era, big data will power consumer products and services (2013) Harvard Business Review, 1, pp. 64-72; Hernandez, I., Zhang, Y., Using predictive analytics and big data to optimize pharmaceutical outcomes (2017) American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy, 74 (18), pp. 1494-1500; Raj, P., Raman, A., Nagaraj, D., Duggirala, S., Big data analytics for healthcare (2015) Computer Communications and Networks, pp. 391-424. , Springer, Berlin, Germany; Eggert, A., Serdaroglu, M., Exploring the impact of sales technology on salesperson performance: A task-base d approach (2011) Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 19 (2), pp. 169-186; Honeycutt, E.D., Thelen, T., Thelen, S.T., Hodge, S.K., Impediments to sales force automation (2005) Industrial Marketing Management, 34 (4), pp. 313-322; Jelinek, R., Ahearne, M., Mathieu, J., Schillewaert, N., A longitudinal examination of individual, organizational, and contextual factors on sales technology adoption and job performance (2006) Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 14 (1), pp. 7-23; Block, W.C., Golterman, J., Wecksell, J., Scherburger, K., (1996) Building Blocks for Technology-Enabled Selling, , Report R-100-104, Gartner, Stamford, CT, USA; Speier, C., Venkatesh, V., The hidden minefields in the adoption of sales force automation technologies (2002) Journal of Marketing, 66 (3), pp. 98-111; Barker, R.M., Gohmann, S.F., Guan, J., Faulds, D.J., Why is my sales force automation system failing?

APT in the power grid is a continual and stealthy attack that analyzes the interaction between the cyber layer and the physical layer. The existing offensive and defensive processes for power grid using honeypots against APTs are modeled based on full rationality. Therefore, both the attacker and the defender make decisions to maximize their payoffs under full rationality. However, fully rational decisions made by end-users are not always conformed with the real cases, and prospect theory is a typical boundedly rational method to model these deviations. In this study, we propose a subjective APT-honeypot game model to study the offensive and defensive interactions between the attacker and the defender based on the prospect theory. In this model, we protect the power grid bus nodes by deploying honeypots, which consider both low- and high-interaction honeypot modes. We prove the existence of Bayesian-Nash equilibrium strategies in defense and attack strategies under bounded rationality. In addition, we used IEEE-30 Bus system to verify the proposed model in this paper. Experiment results show that bounded rationality affects strategy selection and reduces attacker's payoffs. © 2013 IEEE.","APT; game theory; Honeypot; power grid; prospect theory","Game theory; Network security; Attack strategies; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Bounded rationality; Game models; Network attack; Prospect theory; Rational methods; Strategy selection; Electric power transmission networks",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61602247, 61702235, U1636117, U1836104

However, this will emerge new vulnerabilities which in turn will emerge attack vectors like Advanced Persistent Threat attack (APT) to gain unauthorized access to the transportation system. APT causes disruption and data loss as well as integrity violations. This leads to overhead the network and makes it harder to verify each and every transaction between the vehicles. Because of these issues and other security-related shortages like processing time, the need for a solution that specifies all requirements and implementations to be protected against APT attacks and any zero-day attack or any unknown hidden threat emerged from the new vehicle communications, is becoming essential. This paper is to utilize Blockchain technology to secure and protect the transportation system. It will propose an authentication approach using a random number generator to verify vehicle identity and authority, improve the security, integrity, and immutability of the transportation system. An experimental scenario has been also demonstrated to clearly explain the new authentication method. It shows that it is an effective approach to increase security defense lines and provide a secure infrastructure for the transportation system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Authentication; Blockchain; IoT; Security; Transportation systems","Authentication; Blockchain; Intelligent computing; Internet of things; Number theory; Random number generation; Vehicle to infrastructure; Vehicles; Authentication methods; Effective approaches; Random number generators; Security; Security defense; Transportation system; Unauthorized access; Vehicle communications; Vehicle to vehicle communications",,,,,,,,,"Zeadally, S., Hunt, R., Chen, Y.-S., Irwin, A., Hassan, A., Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETS): Status, results, and challenges (2012) Telecommun.

In order to evade the detection of security tools, attackers usually use the legal credentials retained on the compromised hosts to move laterally between computers across the enterprise intranet for searching valuable information. However, attackers cannot acquire the information about the normal action patterns of intranet users. So even the savviest attacker will “blindly move” in the intranet, making his lateral movement usually different from the typical users’ behavior. In order to identify this potential malicious lateral movement, we proposes a Continuous-Temporal Lateral Movement Detection framework CTLMD. The remote and local authentication events are represented as a Path Connection Graph and a Bipartite Graph respectively. We extract normal lateral movement paths with time constraints while abnormal lateral movement paths are generated based on several attack scenarios. Finally, we define multiple path features using graph embedding methods to complete the follow-up classification task. We evaluate our framework by using injected attack data in real enterprise network dataset (LANL). Our experimental results show that the proposed framework can classify normal and malicious lateral movement paths well with the highest AUC of 92%. Meanwhile, the framework can detect the lateral movement state timely and effectively. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Enterprise intranet security; Graph embedding; Lateral movement detection","Complex networks; Embeddings; Intranets; Motion analysis; Attack scenarios; Classification tasks; Connection graphs; Enterprise networks; Graph embeddings; Intranet security; Lateral movement; Time constraints; Graph theory",,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2016YFB0801001","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFB0801001).",,,"Morgan, J.P., Chase Hack Affects 76 Million Households, , https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/jpmorgan-discovers-further-cyber-security-issues/; Home Depot Hackers Exposed 53 Million Email Addresses, , http://www.wsj.com/articles/home-depot-hackers-used-password-stolen-from-vendor-1415309282; Top 20 Lateral Movement Tactics, , https://www.smokescreen.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Top-20-Lateral-Movement-Tactics.pdf; How Do Threat Actors Move Deeper into Your Network, , http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/ent-primers/pdf/tlplateralmovement.pdf; Zeadally, S., Yu, B., Jeong, D.H., Liang, L., Detecting insider threats: Solutions and trends (2012) Inf.

To protect the social multimedia contents in a network, information security education has been actively studied, and various educational systems are being provided. Even when trainees have completed the training that they can practice, such as DDoS(Distributed Denial of Services) response and database outbreak attack, most of the education methods are based on the theory or advance notification method designed as part of the scenario beforehand and it is difficult to apply these to actual situations. In addition, building new systems and learning to use them for each scenario lowers the training effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate various cases of cyber incident in the content distribution networks. Based on research, we develop Meltdown, Mirai malware, Carbanak APT(Advanced Persistent Threats), and Ransomware scenarios that assume a real multimedia contents distribution situation. We also build and store individual virtual environments for each scenario, integrating them into VMWare ESXI, so that attack and defense practices can be conducted similar to real world networks. The deployed environment is integrated with the Web through the VM API(Virtual Machine Application Programming Interfaces). When the trainee finishes the training, one utilizes the snapshot function of the virtual machine to return the virtual environment to the pre-training state. Trainees do not need to build a virtual environment for each scenario, but they are able to conduct training in an environment similar to a real network by calling a virtual environment with a simple operation from a web browser. Therefore, it is expected that the convenience of trainees and the efficiency of the education will be increased. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Case of cyber incident; Education system; Malware; Scenario; Virtual machine","Application programming interfaces (API); Denial-of-service attack; Distributed database systems; E-learning; Network security; Virtual machine; Virtual reality; Content distribution; Content distribution networks; Distributed denial of service; Education systems; Information security education; Multimedia contents; Scenario; Training effectiveness; Malware",,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE: 2018R1D1A1B07047395

The theory of hysteresis points out that, under certain conditions, demand disturbances can have permanent effects. We find strong evidence of unemployment hysteresis in advanced economies since the 1990s. Relying on an identification scheme instigated by an insider/outsider model, we exploit the heterogeneity in impulse responses to demand shocks to investigate what labor institutions soften or amplify these responses. Our results indicate that strengthening labor institutions that promote a faster adjustment of real wages, removing disincentives for firms to hire and for workers to be employed, and improving the matching between labor supply and demand can lessen the effects of adverse demand shocks and lead to a faster reversion of unemployment rates to pre-shock levels. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","advanced economies; heterogeneous dynamics; hysteresis; panel VAR; unemployment persistence",,,,,,,,,,"Amisano, G., Serati, M., What Goes up Some-times Stays Up: Shocks and Institutions as Determinants of Unemployment Persistence (2003) Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 50 (4), pp. 440-470; Ball, L., DeLong, B., Summers, L., (2014) Fiscal Policy and Full Employment; Ball, L.M., (2009) Hysteresis in Unemployment: Old and New Evidence, , In National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 14818; Balmaseda, M., Dolado, J.J., David Lopez-Salido, J., The Dynamic Effects of Shocks to Labour Markets: Evidence from OECD Countries (2000) Oxford Economic Papers, 52 (1), pp. 3-23; Blanchard, O.J., Should We Reject the Natural Rate Hypothesis?

It provides a rational choice response to key insights of historical institutionalist scholarship. Many existing theories—such as rational choice and sociological institutionalisms—explain the timing of change mainly by listing its causes. An analysis of the timing of change in many realms of institutional activity, however, demonstrates that incentives to alter institutions frequently accumulate, unaddressed for extended periods of time. The result is persistent institutional suboptimality, punctuated intermittently by phases of transformation. To account for divergence from the expectations of existing theories, I test two hypotheses concerning the role of transaction costs and temporal coordination dilemmas in hindering change. Introducing the concept of Temporal Focal Points, the article explains why temporal landmarks, such as international crises and prominent anniversaries, are frequently associated with non-linear, transformative change. To assess the explanatory potential of this framework, I analyze the record of change in United Nations environmental institutions.

The overwhelming majority of publications in this subject area contain results that take into account only persistent hardware refusals but the functioning of software defined networks is significantly affected by failures of both software and hardware. In paper the advanced method of designing the model of telecommunications equipment reliability is substantiated considering the factors complex affecting reliability based on a special type of regenerating process. The complex influence of failures and refusals on the reliability indicators of the main telecommunication equipment parameters of a network fragment with structural and temporary redundancy was evaluated. The important factor in reducing the negative effects of failures on reliability is the parameter of temporary redundancy which leads to a decrease in the equipment refusals number. © 2019 IEEE.","5G networks planning; Failures; Redundancy; Refusals; Reliability; Telecommunication equipment","5G mobile communication systems; Complex networks; Failure (mechanical); Information theory; Quality of service; Queueing networks; Redundancy; Reliability; Advanced modeling; Equipment reliability; G-networks; Network fragments; Refusals; Reliability indicators; Software and hardwares; Structure elements; Telecommunication equipment",,,,,,,,,"Ahmada, W., Reliability modeling and analysis of communication networks (2017) Journal of Network and Computer Applications., 78 (15), pp. 191-215. , W.

Atmospheric oxidation (by ambient oxygen molecules) of this class of persistent environmental pollutants has little to no kinetic feasibility due to very sizable activation energies in the entrance channel. The current control measures involve energy-intensive source incineration of contaminated materials at high temperatures as high as 850 °C. This study finds an alternative low-energy approach of destroying dioxin-like compounds, proposing that advanced oxidation by highly reactive singlet oxygen (O2 1Δg, originated from chemical, surface-mediated and photochemical processes) can initiate low-temperature remediation of these pollutants. This contribution completes the first milestone in mapping out the mechanisms of the electrophilic addition of singlet oxygen to unsubstituted and chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (DBD) and dibenzofuran (DBF) structures, according to density functional theory DFT-B3LYP method in conjunction with the 6–311+g(d,p) basis set, as well as energy refinements based on the approximate spin-projection scheme. The [2+2]-cycloaddition mechanism appears dominant for singlet oxidation of dibenzo-p-dioxin with a fitted rate constant of k(T) = 5.01 × 10−14 exp(-98000/RT). On the other hand, the addition of singlet oxygen to the aromatic ring of dibenzofuran primarily transpires via [4+2]-cycloaddition channel with a fitted rate constant of k(T) = 2.16 × 10−13 exp(-119000/RT). The results suggest that application of singlet oxygen can reduce the energy cost of recycling halogenated and flame retarded materials. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Dioxin; Furan; Low-temperature oxidation; PCDDs/PCDFs; Singlet oxygen","dibenzofuran; dioxin; furan; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; singlet oxygen; dioxin; furan derivative; singlet oxygen; dioxin; flame retardant; furan; organic pollutant; oxidation; oxygen; PCDD; PCDF; toxicity; Article; chlorination; cycloaddition; density functional theory; geometry; high temperature; incineration; kinetics; low temperature; oxidation; photochemistry; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; oxidation reduction reaction; pollutant; procedures; temperature; Dioxins; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Furans; Oxidation-Reduction; Singlet Oxygen; Temperature",,"dibenzofuran, 132-64-9; furan, 110-00-9; Dioxins; Environmental Pollutants; Furans; Singlet Oxygen",,,"National Computational Infrastructure, NCI

While protective oxide coating layers such as LiNbO3 (LNO) have been proposed, its precise working mechanisms are still not fully understood. Existing literature attributes reductions in interfacial impedance growth to the coating's ability to prevent interfacial reactions. However, its true nature is more complex, with cathode interfacial reactions and electrolyte electrochemical decomposition occurring simultaneously, making it difficult to decouple each effect. Herein, we utilized various advanced characterization tools and first-principles calculations to probe the interfacial phenomenon between solid electrolyte Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and high-voltage cathode LiNi0.85Co0.1Al0.05O2 (NCA). We segregated the effects of spontaneous reaction between LPSCl and NCA at the interface and quantified the intrinsic electrochemical decomposition of LPSCl during cell cycling. Both experimental and computational results demonstrated improved thermodynamic stability between NCA and LPSCl after incorporation of the LNO coating. Additionally, we revealed the in situ passivation effect of LPSCl electrochemical decomposition. When combined, both these phenomena occurring at the first charge cycle result in a stabilized interface, enabling long cyclability of all-solid-state batteries.

Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) treatment has recently been found to show promise as a treatment method for 1,4-dioxane removal, but the associated decomposition rate of 1,4-dioxane is known to be very sensitive to water quality characteristics. Some computational models have been proposed to predict the decomposition rate of micropollutants during VUV treatment, but the effects of only bicarbonate and natural organic matter have been considered in the models. In the present study, we attempted to develop a versatile computational model for predicting the behavior of 1,4-dioxane during VUV treatment that took into account the effects of other coexisting inorganic ions commonly found in natural waters. We first conducted 1,4-dioxane decomposition experiments with low-pressure mercury lamps and test waters that had been prepared by adding various inorganic ions to an aqueous phosphate buffer. The apparent decomposition rate of 1,4-dioxane was suppressed when bicarbonate, chloride, and nitrate were added to the test waters. Whereas bicarbonate and chloride directly suppressed the apparent decomposition rate by consuming HO•, nitrate became influential only after being transformed into nitrite by concomitant UV light (λ = 254 nm) irradiation. Cl-related radicals (Cl• and Cl2•−) did not react with 1,4-dioxane directly. A computational model consisting of 31 ordinary differential equations with respect to time that had been translated from 84 reactions (10 photochemical and 74 chemical reactions) among 31 chemical species was then developed for predicting the behavior of 1,4-dioxane during VUV treatment. Nine of the parameters in the ordinary differential equations were determined by least squares fitting to an experimental dataset that included different concentrations of bicarbonate, chloride, nitrate, and nitrite. Without further parameter adjustments, the model successfully predicted the behavior of 1,4-dioxane during VUV treatment of three groundwaters naturally contaminated with 1,4-dioxane as well as one dechlorinated tap water sample supplemented with 1,4-dioxane. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","advanced oxidation process; Bicarbonate; Chloride; Nitrate; Nitrite","Chlorine compounds; Computation theory; Computational methods; Forecasting; Groundwater; Ions; Nitrates; Ordinary differential equations; Photochemical reactions; Potable water; Water filtration; Water quality; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Bicarbonate; Chloride; Low pressure mercury lamps; Natural organic matters; Nitrite; Organic micro-pollutants; Water quality characteristics; Chemical water treatment; ammonia; bicarbonate; calcium ion; chloride; chloride ion; dioxane; drinking water; ground water; ion; magnesium ion; mercury; nitrate; nitrite; potassium ion; river water; sodium ion; sulfate; tap water; 1,4-dioxane; dioxane derivative; bicarbonate; chemical reaction; chloride; drinking water; experimental study; filtration; ion; nitrate; nitrite; organic matter; oxidation; simulation; ultraviolet radiation; water quality; water treatment; absorption; Article; chemical reaction; concentration (parameter); dechlorination; decomposition; mathematical model; priority journal; quantum yield; vacuum ultraviolet treatment; water contamination; water management; water quality; water sampling; oxidation reduction reaction; ultraviolet radiation; vacuum; water pollutant; Dioxanes; Oxidation-Reduction; Ultraviolet Rays; Vacuum; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; bicarbonate, 144-55-8, 71-52-3; calcium ion, 14127-61-8; chloride, 16887-00-6; dioxane, 123-91-1; magnesium ion, 22537-22-0; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; nitrate, 14797-55-8; nitrite, 14797-65-0; potassium ion, 24203-36-9; sodium ion, 17341-25-2; sulfate, 14808-79-8; 1,4-dioxane; Dioxanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","This research was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) ( 16H06362 ) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science .",,,"Abe, A., Distribution of 1,4-dioxane in relation to possible sources in the water environment (1999) Sci.

The adversarial nature of the security domain, and APTs in particular, poses unresolved challenges to the design of self-*systems, such as how to defend against multiple types of attackers with different goals and capabilities. In this interaction, the observability of each side is an important and under-investigated issue in the self-*domain. We propose a model of APT defense that elevates observability as a first-class concern. We evaluate this model by showing how an informed approach that uses observability improves the defender's utility compared to a uniform random strategy, can enable robust planning through sensitivity analysis, and can inform observability-related architectural design decisions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adaptive Systems; Advanced Persistent Threats; Game Theory; Observability","Adaptive systems; Formal methods; Game theory; Sensitivity analysis; Systems analysis; Advanced Persistent Threats; Architectural design decisions; Random strategy; Robust planning; Security domains; Software systems; Observability",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CCF-1618220

However, its application to cyber security issues especially threats that involves multiple variables interacting with the technical as well as the organizational domain is lacking. In this respect, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is regarded as a highly targeted and sophisticated attack using zero-day malware, stealth, and multiple advanced techniques to gain entry and maintain its presence inside organizational network unnoticed. Being a threat that exploits technical as well as organizational vulnerabilities, preventing it at the security perimeter and, detecting it once it enters the system is a challenge till date. To demonstrate the application of SD in identifying and analyzing the effect of each of the variables, we took the Equinox data breach as a case study. The variables leading to the breach were identified, entered into Vensim software and simulated to get the results. Through this exercise, we could identify seven key independent management variables for the technical security and three key independent variables for records breach. This research being the foremost study to apply SD to APT, we presume that by modelling APT attacks using SD through a case study this paper, thus provides insights into the dynamics of the threat. Furthermore, it suggests 'what if' strategies to minimize APT risks thereby reduce the extent of damages should an APT attack occur. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber-threats; Data breach; Systems dynamic","Cloud computing; Social sciences computing; System theory; Advanced persistent threats; Cyber threats; Data breach; Independent variables; Organizational network; Systems dynamics; Technical security; Vensim softwares; Malware",,,,,,,,,"Trček, D., Using systems dynamics for human resources management in information systems security (2006) Kybernetes, 35 (7-8), pp. 1014-1023; Georgantzas, N.C., Katsamakas, E.G., Information systems research with system dynamics (2008) System Dynamics Review: The Journal of the System Dynamics Society, 24 (3), pp. 247-264; Martinez-Moyano, I.J., Rich, E., Conrad, S., Andersen, D.F., Stewart, T.R., A behavioral theory of insider-threat risks: A system dynamics approach (2008) ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS), 18 (2), p. 7; Hunker, J., Probst, C.W., Insiders and insider threats-an overview of definitions and mitigation techniques (2011) JoWUA, 2 (1), pp. 4-27; Wang, Y., Wang, Y., Liu, J., Huang, Z., A network gene-based framework for detecting advanced persistent threats (2014) 2014 Ninth International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing, pp. 97-102. , November.

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) represent stealthy, powerful, and well-funded attacks against CPSs; they integrate physical processes and have recently become an active research area. Existing offensive and defensive processes for APTs in CPSs are usually modeled by incomplete information game theory. However, honeypots, which are effective security vulnerability defense mechanisms, have not been widely adopted or modeled for defense against APT attacks in CPSs. In this study, a honeypot game-theoretical model considering both low- and high-interaction modes is used to investigate the offensive and defensive interactions, so that defensive strategies against APTs can be optimized. In this model, human analysis and honeypot allocation costs are introduced as limited resources. We prove the existence of Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategies and obtain the optimal defensive strategy under limited resources. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in obtaining the optimal defensive effect. © 2019 Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","advanced persistent threat; cyber security; game theory; honeypot; limited resources","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Network security; Numerical methods; advanced persistent threat; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Honeypots; Incomplete information games; limited resources; Security vulnerabilities; Game theory",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61602247, 61702235, U1636117, U1836104

APT refers to knowledgeable human attackers that are organized, highly sophisticated and motivated to achieve their objectives against a targeted organization(s) over a prolonged period. Strategically-motivated APTs or S-APTs are distinct in that they draw their objectives from the broader strategic agenda of third parties such as criminal syndicates, nation-states, and rival corporations. In this paper we review the use of the term “advanced persistent threat,” and present a formal definition. We then draw on military science, the science of organized conflict, for a theoretical basis to develop a rigorous and holistic model of the stages of an APT operation which we subsequently use to explain how S-APTs execute their strategically motivated operations using tactics, techniques and procedures. Finally, we present a general disinformation model, derived from situation awareness theory, and explain how disinformation can be used to attack the situation awareness and decision making of not only S-APT operators, but also the entities that back them. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced persistent threat; APT; Cybersecurity; Information security management; Situation awareness theory; Strategic disinformation","Decision making; Security of data; Advanced persistent threat; Cyber security; Information security managements; Situation awareness; Strategic disinformation; Decision theory",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP160102277","This work is supported by the Australian Research Council through the Discovery Projects scheme ( DP160102277 ) – Enhancing Information Security Management through Organisational Learning.",,,"Ahmad, A., Bosua, R., Scheepers, R., Protecting organizational competitive advantage: a knowledge leakage perspective (2014) Comput.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid strategy game-based dynamic defense model to optimally allocate constrained secure resources for the target network. In addition, values of profits of players in this game are computed by a novel data-fusion method called NetF. Based on network protocols and log documents, the NetF deciphers data packets collected from different networks to natural language to make them comparable. Using this algorithm, data observed from the Internet and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be fused to calculate the comprehensive payoff of every node precisely. The Nash equilibrium can be computed using the value to detect the possibility of a node being a malicious node. Using this method, the dynamic optimal defense strategy can be allocated to every node at different times, which enhances the security of the target network obviously. In experiments, we illustrate the obtained results via case studies of a cluster of heterogeneous networks. The results guide planning of optimal defense strategies for different kinds of nodes at different times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced persistent threat; Dynamic defense strategy; Game theory; Heterogeneous network; Information fusion","Data fusion; Game theory; Heterogeneous networks; Information fusion; Network protocols; Network security; Advanced persistent threat; Data fusion methods; Defense strategy; Hybrid strategies; Malicious nodes; Nash equilibria; Natural languages; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,,,"Research and Development

After an attack has been discovered, security administrators have to manually determine which hosts were compromised to clean and restore them. For that, they have to analyze a large number of hosts. In this paper, we propose an approach to efficiently reconstruct the lateral movement of attackers from a given set of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that can help security administrators to identify and prioritize potentially compromised hosts. To reconstruct attacker paths in a network, we link hosts with IoCs via two methods: k-shortest-paths and biased random walks. To evaluate the accuracy of these approaches in reconstructing attack paths, we introduce three models of attackers that differ in their network knowledge. Our results indicate that we can approximate the lateral movement of the three proposed attacker models, even when the attacker significantly deviates from them. For insider attackers that deviate up to 75% from our models, the method based on k-shortest-paths achieves a true positive rate of 88% and can significantly narrow down the set of nodes to analyse to 5% of all network hosts. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Given the big data nature of Internet traffic data and the ability of algorithmically generating domains and acquiring and registering the domains in a near-automated fashion, detecting malicious domains in real-time is a daunting task for security analysts and network operators. In this paper, we introduce bipartite graphs to capture the interactions between end hosts and domains, identify associated IP addresses of domains, and characterize time-series patterns of DNS queries for domains, and explore one-mode projections of these bipartite graphs for modeling the behavioral, IP-structural, and temporal similarities between domains. We employ graph embedding technique to automatically learn dynamic and discriminative feature representations for over 10,000 labeled domains, and develop an SVM-based classification algorithm for predicting malicious or benign domains. Our model makes the progress towards adapting to the changing and evolving strategies of malicious domains. The experimental results have shown that our proposed algorithm achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 based on k-fold cross-validation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to apply the combination of behavioral modeling and graph embedding for effectively and accurately detecting malicious domains. © 2019 IEEE.","Behavioral Modeling; Graph Embedding; Malicious Domain Detection","Behavioral research; Command and control systems; Distributed computer systems; Embeddings; Internet protocols; Support vector machines; Area under the curves; Behavioral model; Classification algorithm; Discriminative features; Domain detections; Graph embeddings; K fold cross validations; Time series patterns; Graph theory",,,,,"2018A030313017

When an APT campaign on an organization has been identified, the available repair resources must be reasonably allocated to the potentially insecure hosts to mitigate the potential loss of the organization. We refer to the feasible repair resource allocation strategies as repair strategies. This paper focuses on the APT repair problem, i.e., the problem of developing effective repair strategies for organizations. First, for an organization with time-varying communication relationship, we establish an evolution model of the organization's expected state, in which the impact of lateral movement of APT is accommodated. On this basis, we model the APT repair problem as a differential Nash game problem (the APT repair game) in which the attacker attempts to maximize his potential benefit, and the organization manages to minimize its potential loss. Second, we derive a system (the potential system) for calculating a potential Nash equilibrium of an APT repair game, and we examine the structure of the potential attack and repair strategies in a potential Nash equilibrium. Next, we solve some potential systems to get the corresponding potential Nash equilibria. Finally, by comparison with a large number of randomly generated attack and repair strategies, we conclude that the potential Nash equilibrium of each APT repair game is a Nash equilibrium of the game. Therefore, we recommend to organizations their respective potential repair strategies. Our findings help to better understand and effectively defend against APT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","advanced persistent threat; APT repair problem; Cybersecurity; differential Nash game; epidemic modeling; potential Nash equilibrium","Computation theory; Game theory; advanced persistent threat; APT repair problem; Cyber security; Epidemic modeling; Nash equilibria; Nash games; Repair",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: LP170100458

Co-creation is a suitable approach for developing and implementing digital technologies and transforming the service accordingly. This study aimed to identify the facilitators and barriers for implementation of digital monitoring technology in residential care for persons with dementia and wandering behaviour, and explore co-creation as an implementation strategy and practice. Methods: In this longitudinal case study, we observed and elicited the experiences of care providers and healthcare managers in eight nursing homes, in addition to those of the information technology (IT) support services and technology vendors, during a four-year implementation process. We were guided by theories on innovation, implementation and learning, as well as co-creation and design. The data were analysed deductively using a determinants of innovation framework, followed by an inductive content analysis of interview and observation data. Results: The implementation represented radical innovation and required far more resources than the incremental changes anticipated by the participants. Five categories of facilitators and barriers were identified, including several subcategories for each category: 1) Pre-implementation preparations; 2) Implementation strategy; 3) Technology stability and usability; 4) Building competence and organisational learning; and 5) Service transformation and quality management. The combination of IT infrastructure instability and the reluctance of the IT support service to contribute in co-creating value with the healthcare services was the most persistent barrier. Overall, the co-creation methodology was the most prominent facilitator, resulting in a safer night monitoring service. Conclusion: Successful implementation of novel digital monitoring technologies in the care service is a complex and time-consuming process and even more so when the technology allows care providers to radically transform clinical practices at the point of care, which offers new affordances in the co-creation of value with their residents. From a long-term perspective, the digital transformation of municipal healthcare services requires more advanced IT competence to be integrated directly into the management and provision of healthcare and value co-creation with service users and their relatives. © 2019 The Author(s).","Absorptive capacity; Radical innovation; Risk; Service design; Triple helix; Workflow","aged; ambulatory monitoring; dementia; devices; human; longitudinal study; nursing home; organization and management; physiologic monitoring; trends; very elderly; wireless communication; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Dementia; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Monitoring, Physiologic; Nursing Homes; Wireless Technology",,,,,"229883, 234978","The Regional Research Fund in Norway (project numbers 229883 and 234978) and the University of South-Eastern Norway, Faculty of Health and Social Sciences funded the study.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are treatment methods that have been used to successfully degrade organic contaminants in water, soil, sediments and sludge. Reaction rate constants (k) for peroxy acid treatment of 10 substituted naphthalene compounds were determined. The treatment method utilized acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide and a sulphuric acid catalyst to degrade the polyaromatic structures found in the compounds. Molecular structures of the selected compounds were derived at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. Property-encoded surface translator (PEST) descriptors were calculated from B3LYP/6-31G* optimized structures and were found to have significant levels of correlation with k. Models using minimum local ionization potential (PIP.MIN) and a histogram [bin] of the gradient of the K electronic kinetic energy normal to the isosurface (DKN) were evaluated and found to agree within 10% of experimentally derived values of k in most instances. Results show that a combination of PEST descriptors could be used to predict reactivity by the peroxy-acid process. The PEST technology could prove to be a valuable asset for effective remediation design by predicting reaction outcomes for substituted naphthalene compounds and possibly other hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AOP; local IP; naphthalenes; PEST; remediation","acetic acid; hydrogen peroxide; naphthalene derivative; sulfuric acid; catalysis; chemistry; molecular model; oxidation reduction reaction; structure activity relation; Acetic Acid; Catalysis; Hydrogen Peroxide; Models, Molecular; Naphthalenes; Oxidation-Reduction; Structure-Activity Relationship; Sulfuric Acids",,"acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; sulfuric acid, 7664-93-9; Acetic Acid; Hydrogen Peroxide; Naphthalenes; sulfuric acid; Sulfuric Acids",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: BES-0093191

However, users of the NAS, i.e., Air transport operators, UAS operators, etc. are beginning to use this technology throughout their operations. At issue within the broader aviation marketplace, is the continued search for a solution set to the persistent daily delays and schedule perturbations that occur within the NAS. Despite billions invested through the NAS Modernization Program, the delays persist in the face of reduced demand for commercial routings. Every delay represents an economic loss to commercial transport operators, passengers, freighters, and any business depending on the transportation performance. Therefore, the FAA needs to begin to address from an advanced concepts perspective, what this wave of new technology will affect as it is brought to bear on various operations performance parameters, including safety, security, efficiency, and resiliency solution sets. This paper is the first in a series of papers we are developing to explore the application of AI in the National Airspace System (NAS). This first paper is meant to get everyone in the aviation community on the same page, a primer if you will, to start the technical discussions. This paper will define AI; the capabilities associated with AI; current use cases within the aviation ecosystem; and how to prepare for insertion of AI in the NAS. The next series of papers will look at NAS Operations Theory utilizing AI capabilities and eventually leading to a future intelligent NAS (iNAS) environment. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Losses; Air transport; Artificial intelligence technologies; Commercial transport; Economic loss; Modernization programs; National airspace system; Performance parameters; Transportation system; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,"Post, T.W., (2018) Inspector General's Report Says the FAA Has Bungled A $36 Billion Project, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/inspector-generals-report-says-the-faa-hasbungled-a-36-billion-project/2018/03/08/5436c6ba-22f6-11e8-badd-7c9f29a55815_story.html?utm_term=.2bc6211a0273, Retrieved from WashingtonPost. com, March 8; (2016) Why Artificial Intelligence Is A, , https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/audit/us-ai-risk-powers-performance.pdf, Retrieved from deloitte. com; (2018) Metcalfe's Law, , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/metcalfe's_law, Oxford Dictionaries.

These benefits are fueled by innovations in orchestration of cloud platforms that make them programmable as Software Defined everything Infrastructures (SDxI). At the same time, sophisticated targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are growing on an unprecedented scale threatening the availability of online businesses. In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of targeted attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a ‘pretense’ in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via ‘quarantine virtual machines’ and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS and APT attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block attacks closer to the attack source(s). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced persistent threats; DDoS attacks; Network analytics for targeted attack defense; Pretense theory; Software-defined infrastructure","Distributed computer systems; Network security; Advanced persistent threats; DDoS Attack; Distributed denial of service; Feature analysis; Multiple networks; Pretense theory; Real time capability; Targeted attacks; Denial-of-service attack",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CNS-1205658","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation, USA under Award Number: CNS-1205658 .

However, the difficulties associated with the AD stable operation have prevented its worldwide application. The intrinsic complexity of the physicochemical and biological characteristics combined with the uncertain feedstock conditions, time lags and the lack of reliable measurements have hindered the application of a number of classical and advanced control strategies to deal with the control problem. On the other hand, robust H∞ theory offers a solid framework to handle feedback regulation of state variables on the plant frequency response in the face of disturbances and model uncertainties. This contribution presents a robust H∞ mixed sensitivity control design and tuning for output disturbances rejection and it is applied to an anaerobic digestion plant. This H∞ control holds the balance between robustness in the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) regulation and control effort. Simulation results show the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed design and tuning method. COD can effectively be regulated under: (i) load perturbations; (ii) model uncertainties and (iii) persistent output disturbances induced by COD measurement faults. The controller is applied to anaerobic digestion process but the approach can be implemented in distinct applications for organic matter degradation and other similar bioprocess and biological systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Robust H∞ control; Uncertain model; Wastewater treatment processes","Chemical oxygen demand; Decentralized control; Disturbance rejection; Frequency response; Process control; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater treatment; Advanced control strategy; Anaerobic digestion process; Biological characteristic; Organic matter degradations; Regulation and control; Robust H; Uncertain modeling; Wastewater treatment process; Anaerobic digestion",,,,,,,,,"Holm-Nielsen, J.B., Seadi, T.A., Oleskowicz-Popiel, P., The future of anaerobic digestion and biogas utilization (2009) Bioresour.

Existing security protection works typically either focus on one-shot case, or separate detection from response decisions. Such practices lead to tractable analysis, but miss key inherent APTs persistence and risk heterogeneity. To this end, we propose a Lyapunov-based security-aware defense mechanism backed by threat intelligence, where robust defense strategy-making is based on acquired heterogeneity knowledge. By exploring temporal evolution of risk level, we introduce priority-aware virtual queues, which together with attack queues, enable security-aware response among hosts. Specifically, a long-term time average profit maximization problem is formulated. We first develop risk admission control policy to accommodate hosts' risk tolerance and response capacity. Under multiple attacker resources, defense control policy is implemented on two-stage decisions, involving proportional fair resource allocation and host-attack assignment. In particular, distributed auction-based assignment algorithm is designed to capture uncertainty in the number of resolved attacks, where high-risk host-attack pairs are prioritized over others. We theoretically prove our mechanism can guarantee bounded queue backlogs, profit optimality, no underflow condition, and robustness to detection errors. Simulations on real-world data set corroborate theoretical analysis and reveal the importance of security awareness. © 2018 IEEE.","APT attacks; distributed auction algorithm; priority-based response; security awareness; threat intelligence","Combinatorial optimization; Computer games; Computers; Electronic mail; Network security; Optimization; Profitability; Queueing theory; Resource allocation; Robustness (control systems); Apt attacks; Distributed auction algorithms; Games; Priority-based; Resource management; Security; Security awareness; threat intelligence; Risk assessment",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 61521062, 61532012, 61602303, 61671478, 61672342

IoBT devices have the ability to collect operational field data, to compute on the data, and to upload its information to the network. Securing the IoBT presents additional challenges compared with traditional information technology (IT) systems. First, IoBT devices are mass produced rapidly to be low-cost commodity items without security protection in their original design. Second, IoBT devices are highly dynamic, mobile, and heterogeneous without common standards. Third, it is imperative to understand the natural world, the physical process(es) under IoBT control, and how these real-world processes can be compromised before recommending any relevant security counter measure. Moreover, unprotected IoBT devices can be used as 'stepping stones' by attackers to launch more sophisticated attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). As a result of these challenges, IoBT systems are the frequent targets of sophisticated cyber attack that aim to disrupt mission effectiveness. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Autonomous vehicles; Game theory; Intelligent robots; Command and control; Common standards; Game-theoretic model; Intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissances; Original design; Physical process; Real-world process; Security protection; Network security",,,,,,,,,,"Kamhoua, C.A.; Army Research Laboratory Network Security BranchUnited States; email: charles.a.kamhoua.civ@mail.mil",,"Coordinated Science Laboratory;Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","56th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, Allerton 2018","2 October 2018 through 5 October 2018",,144914,,9781538665961,,,"English","Annu.

Now that worldwide advanced education is a central agent in developing and disseminating Western rationality emphasizing science as the ultimate truth claim about a humanly constructed society and the natural world this seems an ever more relevant thesis. Yet in the face of a robust “education revolution,” religion and spirituality endure, and in certain respects thrive, thus creating a sociological paradox: How can both expanding education and mass religion coexist? The solution proposed here is that instead of educational development setting the conditions for the decline and eventual death of religion, the two institutions have been, and continue to be, more compatible and even surprisingly symbiotic than is often assumed. This contributes to a culture of mass education and mass religion that is unique in the history of human society, exemplified by the heavily educated and churched United States. After a brief review of the empirical trends behind the paradox, a new confluence of streams of research on compatible worldviews, overlapping ideologies, and their enactments in educational and religious social movements illustrates the plausibility of an affinity argument and its impact on theory about post-secular society. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Desecularization; Education; Institutions; Post-secular society; Religion; Secularization theory",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (1988) The system of professions, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Ayoub, M.M., The Islamic tradition (1996) World religions: Western traditions, pp. 352-491. , Oxtoby WG, (ed), Oxford University Press, Toronto; Bader, C.D., Mencken, F., Baker, J., (2010) Paranormal America: Ghost encounters, UFO sightings, bigfoot hunts, and other curiosities in religion and culture, , New York University Press, New York; Bainbridge, W.S., (1997) The sociology of religious movements, , Psychology Press, London; Baker, D.P., Schooling all the masses: reconsidering the origins of American schooling in the postbellum era (1999) Sociology of Education, 72, pp. 197-215; Baker, D.P., The educational transformation of work: towards a new synthesis (2009) Journal of Education and Work, 22, pp. 163-191; Baker, D.P., Forward and backward, horizontal and vertical: transformation of occupational credentialing in the schooled society (2011) Research in Social Stratification and Mobility: A Journal of the International Sociological Association, 29, pp. 5-29; Baker, J.O., Public perceptions of incompatibility between “science and religion (2012) Public Understanding of Science, , https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662511434908; Baker, D.P., (2014) The schooled society: The educational transformation of global culture, , Stanford University Press, Palo Alto; Baker, D.P., Lenhardt, G., The institutional crisis of the German Research University (2008) Higher Education Policy, 21, pp. 49-64; Baker, D.P., LeTrendre, G., (2005) National differences, global similarities: World culture and the future of schooling, , Stanford University Press, Stanford; Beckford, J., (2003) Social theory and religion, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Bell, D., The return of the sacred?

In this work, we aim to lay a game-theoretic foundation by establishing a multi-stage Bayesian game framework to capture incomplete information of deceptive APTs and their multistage multi-phase movement. The analysis of the perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) enables a prediction of attacker's behaviors and a design of defensive strategies that can deter the adversaries and mitigate the security risks. A conjugate-prior method allows online computation of the belief and reduces Bayesian update into an iterative parameter update. The forwardly updated parameters are assimilated into the backward dynamic programming computation to characterize a computationally tractable and time-consistent equilibrium solution based on the expanded state space. The Tennessee Eastman (TE) process control problem is used as a case study to demonstrate the dynamic game under the information asymmetry and show that APTs tend to be stealthy and deceptive during their transitions in the cyber layer and behave aggressively when reaching the targeted physical plant. The online update of the belief allows the defender to learn the behavior of the attacker and choose strategic defensive actions that can thwart adversarial behaviors and mitigate APTs. Numerical results illustrate the defender's tradeoff between the immediate reward and the future expectation as well as the attacker's goal to reach an advantageous system state while making the defender form a positive belief. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Critical infrastructures; Dynamic programming; Game theory; Iterative methods; Parameter estimation; Public works; Risk assessment; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Defensive strategies; Equilibrium solutions; Incomplete information; Information asymmetry; Online computations; Security challenges; Tennessee Eastman; Network security",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1541164, 1544782, 1550000, 1720230",,,,"Bathelt, A., Ricker, N.L., Jelali, M., Revision of the Tennessee eastman process model (2015) IFAC-PapersOnLine, 48 (8), pp. 309-314; Coppolino, L., D'Antonio, S., Romano, L., Spagnuolo, G., An intrusion detection system for critical information infrastructures using wireless sensor network technologies (2010) Critical Infrastructure (CRIS), 2010 5th International Conference on, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Harsanyi, J.C., Games with incomplete information played by Bayesian players, i-III part i.

D3R Grand Challenge 2 focused on the pose prediction, binding affinity ranking and free energy prediction for Farnesoid X receptor ligands. Our models obtained the top place in absolute free energy prediction for free energy set 1 in stage 2. The latest competition, D3R Grand Challenge 3 (GC3), is considered as the most difficult challenge so far. It has five subchallenges involving Cathepsin S and five other kinase targets, namely VEGFR2, JAK2, p38-α, TIE2, and ABL1. There is a total of 26 official competitive tasks for GC3.

An MSA is launched in multiple sequential stages, which may not be malicious when implemented individually, making the detection of MSAs extremely challenging for most current IDSs. In this paper, we present a novel IDS that exploits contextual information in the form of Pattern-of-Life (PoL), and information related to expert judgment on the network behaviour. This IDS focuses on detecting an MSA, in real-time, without previous training process. The main goal of the MSA is to create a Point of Entry (PoE)to a target machine, which could be used as part of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)like attack. Our results verify that the use of contextual information improves the efficiency of our IDS by enhancing the detection rate of MSAs in real-time by 58%. © 2018 IEEE.","Contextual Information; Dempster-Shafer Theory; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; Intrusion Detection System; Multi-Stage Attack; Network Security; Pattern-of-Life; Point of Entry","Computer crime; Information use; Intrusion detection; Military communications; Contextual information; Dempster-Shafer theory; Fuzzy cognitive map; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-stage attack; Pattern-of-Life; Point of entries; Network security",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/K014307/2, EP/R006377/1, EP/R006385/1

For example, International Deficit Thinking discusses the cases of low-socioeconomic Black and Mexican American students in the United States, Indigenous Māori students in New Zealand, and immigrant Moroccan and Turkish pupils in Belgium. The predominant theoretical perspective that has been advanced to explain the school failure of marginalized students is the deficit thinking paradigm-a parsimonious, endogenous, and pseudoscientific model that blames such students as the makers of their own school failure. Deficit thinking asserts that the low academic achievement of many marginalized students is due to their limited intellectual ability, poor academic achievement motivation, and being raised in dysfunctional families and cultures. Drawing from, in part, critical race theory, systemic inequality analysis, and colonialism/postcolonialism, award-winning author and scholar Richard R.Valencia examines deficit thinking in education in 16 countries (e.g., Canada; Peru, Australia; England; India; South Africa). He seeks to (a) document and debunk deficit thinking as an interpretation for school failure of marginalized students; (b) offer scientifically defensible counternarratives for race-, class-, language-, and gender-based differences in academic achievement; (c) provide suggestions for workable and sustainable school reform for marginalized students. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,"Araujo, R.J., Critical race theory: Contributions to and problems for race relations (1997) Gonzaga Law Review, 32, pp. 537-575; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a Theory of Practice, , Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Campos, D., (2013) Educating Latino Boys: An Asset-Based Approach, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin; Chang, R.S., Toward an Asian American legal scholarship: Critical race theory, post-structuralism, and narrative space (1993) California Law Review, 81, pp. 1241-1323; Cope, Z., (2015) Divided World, Divided Classes: Global Political Economy and the Stratification of Labour under Capitalism, , 2nd ed.).

Though this procedure gives the safety factor based on the limit equilibrium theory, the existence of such plane is highly unlikely, and a complex interaction between pre-existing flaws, stress concentration and resulting crack generation, these are not modeled. The development of advanced numerical methods is the key issues of importance. This paper attempts to develop a numerical procedure providing means to analyze the kinetic failure process and the state of stability using a discrete approach. The ground is modeled with an assembly of mass points connected by a pair of springs, normal and tangential direction and the translational motion of each mass point is calculated by solving the equation of motion.

An APT actor may steal valuable data from the target CSS even in a strategic fashion. To protect a CSS from APT, the cloud defender has to dynamically allocate the limited security resources to recover the compromised storage servers, aiming at mitigating his total loss. This paper addresses this dynamic cloud storage recovery (DCSR) problem by employing differential game theory. First, by introducing an expected state evolution model capturing the CSS's expected state evolution process under a combination of attack strategy and recovery strategy, we measure the APT attacker's net benefit and the cloud defender's total loss. On this basis and in the worst-case situation where the cloud defender assumes that the APT attacker has full knowledge of his expected loss, we reduce the DCSR problem to a differential game-theoretic problem (the DCSR∗ problem) to characterize the strategic interactions between the two parties. Second, we derive a necessary condition for Nash equilibrium of the DCSR∗ problem and thereby introduce the concept of competitive strategy profile. Next, we study the structural properties of the competitive strategy profile, followed by some numerical examples. Then, we conduct extensive comparative experiments to exhibit that the competitive strategy profile is superior to a large number of randomly generated strategy profiles in the sense of Nash equilibrium solution concept. Finally, we briefly analyze the practicability (scalability and feasibility) of this paper. Our findings will be helpful to enhance the APT defense capabilities of the cloud defender. © 2013 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threat; cloud storage recovery; competitive strategy profile; differential game; Nash equilibrium; necessity system; state evolution model","Digital storage; Recovery; Cloud storage systems; Comparative experiments; Competitive strategy; Defense capability; Differential game theory; Differential games; Recovery strategies; Strategic interactions; Game theory",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61572006","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572006.",,"Marinescu, D.C., (2018) Cloud Computing: Theory and Practice, , 2nd ed.

In order to mitigate the impact of APT on an organization, all the compromised systems in the organization must be quarantined and recovered in a timely and effective way. This article focuses on the problem of customizing a dynamic quarantine and recovery (QAR) scheme for an organization so that the APT impact is minimized. Based on a novel node-level epidemic model characterizing the effect of the QAR scheme on the expected state of the underlying network, we estimate the expected impact of APT under a QAR scheme. On this basis, we model the original problem as an optimal control problem. By use of optimal control theory, we derive the optimality system for the optimal control problem and thereby introduce the concept of normal potential optimal (NPO) control. Next, through comparative experiments, we find that the NPO control outperforms a set of heuristic controls. Hence, the QAR scheme associated with the NPO control is satisfactory in terms of the effectiveness of defending against APT. Finally, we examine the effect of some factors on the expected APT impact under the NPO control. This article would be helpful to the defense against APT for cyber espionage.

A key model in this research landscape is FlipIt [1]. However, a limiting simplifying assumption in the FlipIt literature is that costs and gains are not subject to discounting, which contradicts the typical treatment of decision-making over time in most economically relevant contexts. Our recent work [2] introduces an adaptation of the FlipIt model that applies time-based exponential discounting to the value of a protected resource, while allowing players to choose from among the same canonical strategies as in the original game. This paper extends the study of games of timing by introducing two new classes of strategies that are fundamentally motivated by a time-discounted world view. Within our game model, we compute player utilities, best responses and give a partial characterization of the game’s Nash equilibria. Our model allows us to re-interpret the APT model using a finite total valuation, and a finite time horizon. By applying time-based discounting to the entire decision-making framework, we increase the level of realism as well as applicability to organizational security management. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Decision theory; Game theory; Timing circuits; Best response; Decision-making frameworks; Finite time horizon; Nash equilibria; Partial characterization; Security management; Simplifying assumptions; Time dependent; Decision making",,,,,"KU Leuven","Acknowledgments.

It has been shown that deploying all possible detection measures incur a cost on performance by using up valuable computing and networking resources, thereby resulting in Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations promised to the cloud-service users. Thus, there has been a recent interest in developing Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanisms that helps to optimize the joint objective of maximizing security while ensuring that the impact on performance is minimized. Often, these techniques model the challenge of multi-stage attacks by stealthy adversaries as a single-step attack detection game and use graph connectivity measures as a heuristic to measure performance, thereby (1) losing out on valuable information that is inherently present in multi-stage models designed for large cloud networks, and (2) come up with strategies that have asymmetric impacts on performance, thereby heavily affecting the Quality of Service (QoS) for some cloud users. In this work, we use the attack graph of a cloud network to formulate a general-sum Markov Game and use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to come up with meaningful utility values in each state of the game. We then show that, for the threat model in which an adversary has knowledge of a defender’s strategy, the use of Stackelberg equilibrium can provide an optimal strategy for placement of security resources. In cases where this assumption turns out to be too strong, we show that the Stackelberg equilibrium turns out to be a Nash equilibrium of the general-sum Markov Game. We compare the gains obtained using our method(s) to other baseline techniques used in cloud network security. Finally, we highlight how the method was used in a real-world small-scale cloud system. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Computation theory; Decision theory; Digital storage; Game theory; Optimization; Quality of service; Cloud network securities; Common vulnerability scoring systems; Graph connectivity; Moving target defense; Multi-stage models; Scalable securities; Service Level Agreements; Stackelberg equilibrium; Network security",,,,,"N00173-15-G017

We model an APT as a game played on an attack graph G, and consider the following interaction pattern: the attacker chooses an attack path in G towards its target v:0, and step-by-step works its way towards the goal by repeated penetrations. In each step, it leaves a backdoor for an easy return to learn how to accomplish the next step. We call this return path the “rope”. The defender’s aim is “cutting” this rope by cleaning the system from (even unknown) backdoors, e.g., by patching systems or changing configurations. While the defender is doing so in fixed intervals governed by working hours/shifts, the attacker is allowed to take any number of moves at any point in time. The game is thus repeated, i.e., in discrete time, only for the defender, while the second player (adversary) moves in continuous time. It also has asymmetric information, since the adversary is stealthy at all times, until the damage causing phase of the APT. The payoff in the game is the attacker’s chance to reach this final stage, while the defender’s goal is minimizing this likelihood (risk). We illustrate the model by a numerical example and open access implementation in R. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced persistent threats; Attack graph; Attack tree; Cyber defense; Cyber physical system; Security","Continuous time systems; Cyber Physical System; Decision theory; Embedded systems; Network security; Rope; Trees (mathematics); Advanced persistent threats; Attack graph; Attack tree; Cyber defense; Security; Game theory",,,,,,,,"(2018) Analytical Framework for Actionable Defense against Advanced Persistent Threats—UW Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, , https://www.ece.uw.edu/projects/adapt-analytical-framework-for-actionable-defense-against-advanced-persistent-threats/; Alpcan, T., Başar, T., (2010) Network Security: A Decision and Game Theoretic Approach, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; BSI: IT-Grundschutz International (2016) Bundesamt für Sicherheit in Der Infor-Mationstechnik, , https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/ITGrundschutz/ITGrundschutzInternational/itgrundschutzinternationalnode.html; Carroll, T.E., Grosu, D., A game theoretic investigation of deception in network security (2009) 2009 Proceedings of 18Th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, pp. 1-6. , pp., IEEE, San Francisco, August; Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., FlipIt: The game of “Stealthy Takeover” (2013) J.

FlipIt is a security game that models attacker-defender interactions in advanced scenarios such as APTs. Previous work analyzed extensively non-adaptive strategies in FlipIt, but adaptive strategies rise naturally in practical interactions as players receive feedback during the game. We model the FlipIt game as a Markov Decision Process and introduce QFlip, an adaptive strategy for FlipIt based on temporal difference reinforcement learning. We prove theoretical results on the convergence of our new strategy against an opponent playing with a Periodic strategy. We confirm our analysis experimentally by extensive evaluation of QFlip against specific opponents. QFlip converges to the optimal adaptive strategy for Periodic and Exponential opponents using associated state spaces. Finally, we introduce a generalized QFlip strategy with composite state space that outperforms a Greedy strategy for several distributions including Periodic and Uniform, without prior knowledge of the opponent’s strategy. We also release an OpenAI Gym environment for QFlip to facilitate future research. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive strategies; Markov decision processes; Online learning; Reinforcement learning; Security games","Behavioral research; Decision theory; Game theory; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Markov processes; Sports; Adaptive reinforcement; Adaptive strategy; Advanced scenarios; Cryptographic security; Markov Decision Processes; Online learning; Security games; Temporal difference reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CNS-1717634

Data and control flow commands arising from APTs introduce new information flows into the targeted computer system. Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) is a promising detection mechanism against APTs that taints suspicious input sources in the system and authenticates the tainted flows at certain processes according to a well defined security policy. Employing DIFT to defend against APTs in large scale cyber systems is restricted due to the heavy resource and performance overhead introduced on the system. The objective of this paper is to model resource efficient DIFT that successfully detect APTs. We develop a game-theoretic framework and provide an analytical model of DIFT that enables the study of trade-off between resource efficiency and the quality of detection in DIFT. Our proposed infinite-horizon, nonzero-sum, stochastic game captures the performance parameters of DIFT such as false alarms and false-negatives and considers an attacker model where the APT can relaunch the attack if it fails in a previous attempt and thereby continuously engage in threatening the system. We assume some of the performance parameters of DIFT are unknown. We propose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that converges to a Nash equilibrium of the discounted stochastic game between APT and DIFT. We execute and evaluate the proposed algorithm on a real-world nation state attack dataset. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advance persistent threats; Dynamic Information Flow Tracking; Reinforcement learning; Security of computer systems; Stochastic games","Computer control systems; Computer games; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Advance persistent threats; Detection mechanism; Dynamic information flow tracking; Performance parameters; Resource efficiencies; Sensitive informations; Stochastic dynamics; Stochastic game; Game theory",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: DARPA FA8650-15-C-7556, N00014-16-1-2710 P00002","Keywords: Security of computer systems · Advance persistent threats · Dynamic Information Flow Tracking · Stochastic games · Reinforcement learning This work was supported by ONR grant N00014-16-1-2710 P00002 and DARPA TC grant DARPA FA8650-15-C-7556.",,"Alpcan, T., Başar, T., An intrusion detection game with limited observations (2006) International Symposium on Dynamic Games and Applications; Amir, R., (2003) Stochastic Games in Economics and Related Fields: An Overview, 570, pp. 455-470. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-0189-230, In: Neyman, A., Sorin, S.

The oxidative stress theory has been confirmed in many animal studies, which demonstrated that the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and biomolecular stability and integrity is crucial for cellular longevity and successful aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network, alteration in the activities of transcription factors such as Nrf2 and NF-κB, and disturbances in the protein quality control machinery that includes molecular chaperones, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and autophagy/lysosome pathway have been observed during aging and age-related chronic diseases. The accumulation of ROS under oxidative stress conditions results in the induction of lipid peroxidation and glycoxidation reactions, which leads to the elevated endogenous production of reactive aldehydes and their derivatives such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal (MG), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) giving rise to advanced lipoxidation and glycation end products (ALEs and AGEs, respectively). Both ALEs and AGEs play key roles in cellular response to oxidative stress stimuli through the regulation of a variety of cell signaling pathways. However, elevated ALE and AGE production leads to protein cross-linking and aggregation resulting in an alteration in cell signaling and functioning which causes cell damage and death. This is implicated in aging and various age-related chronic pathologies such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, and vascular complications of diabetes mellitus. In the present review, we discuss experimental data evidencing the impairment in cellular functions caused by AGE/ALE accumulation under oxidative stress conditions. We focused on the implications of ALEs/AGEs in aging and age-related diseases to demonstrate that the identification of cellular dysfunctions involved in disease initiation and progression can serve as a basis for the discovery of relevant therapeutic agents. © 2019 Nurbubu T.

Existing Cyber Defence frameworks and data fusion models cannot cope with XAPTs due to a lack of provision for multi-phase attacks characterized by uncertainty and conflicting information. The Markov Multi-phase Transferable Belief Model (MM-TBM) extends the Transferable Belief Model to address the multi-phase nature of cyber-attacks and to obtain previously indeterminable Cyber SA. As a data fusion technique, MM-TBM constitutes a novel approach for performing hypothesis assessment and evidence combination across phases, by means of a new combination rule, called the Multi-phase Combination Rule with conflict Reset (MCR2). The impact of MM-TBM as a Cyber Situational Awareness capability and its implications as a multi-phase data fusion theory have been empirically validated through a series of scenario-based Cyber SA experiments for detecting, tracking, and predicting XAPTs. © 2013 IEEE.","APT; combination rule; conflict; cyberspace; kill-chain; Markov processes; prediction; sensor fusion; situational awareness; uncertainty","Forecasting; Markov processes; Network security; Combination rules; conflict; Cyberspaces; Kill chain; Sensor fusion; Situational awareness; uncertainty; Data fusion",,,,,"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl: DSTLX1000048609","This work was supported in part by the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, under Grant DSTLX1000048609.",,"(2013) Cyberattacks Account for Up to $1 Trillion in Global Losses, , https://www.cnet.com/news/cyberattacksaccount-for-up-to-1-trillion-in-global-losses, CNET.

And the persisted evolution ability destroyed the traditional protection methods based on feature detection.

Nevertheless, the highly virtualized environment in fog computing leads to vulnerability to cyber attacks such as advanced persistent threats. In this paper, we propose a novel game approach of cyber risk management for the fog computing platform. The system model under consideration consists of three main entities, i.e., the fog computing provider, attacker, and cyber-insurer. The fog computing provider dynamically optimizes the allocation of its defense computing resources to improve the security of the fog computing platform which is composed of multiple fog nodes. Meanwhile, the attacker dynamically adjusts the allocation of its attack computing resources to increase the probability of successful attack. To prevent from the potential loss due to the attacks, the provider also makes dynamic decision on the subscription of cyber-insurance for each fog node. Thereafter, the cyber-insurer accordingly determines the premium of cyber-insurance for each fog node. To model this dynamic interactive decision making problem, we formulate a dynamic Stackelberg game. We analytically prove that the evolutionary equilibrium is unique and stable, and we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium by capitalizing on tools from optimal control theory.Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the dynamic Stackelberg game.

There is more number of targeted attacks happening in recent years. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are the most complex and highly sophisticated attack in present scenario. Due to the sophistication of these attacks, it can be able to bypass the deployed security controls and more stealthily infiltrate the targeted internal network. Detection of these attacks are very challenging because they treated normal behaviors to hide itself from traditional detection mechanism. In this paper, we analyze the 26 APT campaigns reports and shows the different methods and techniques that are used by attacker to perform the sophisticated attacks. Our research is mainly focused on the three levels of investigation of APT campaigns that give some common characteristics of them such as APT attack usage zero-day vulnerability or not. Furthermore, according to their characteristics, we propose a novel approach that is capable to early detection of APTs and also suggest concrete prevention mechanism that make it possible to identify the intrusions as early as possible. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Advanced persistent attacks; Attack phases; Attack vector; Sophisticated attacks; Vulnerability","Soft computing; Advanced persistent attacks; Attack phases; Attack vector; Sophisticated attacks; Vulnerability; Computation theory",,,,,,,,"(2015) Mandiant: M-trends—a View from the Front Lines, , Mandiant, Technical Report; Tankard, C., (2011) Advanced Persistent Threats and How to Monitor and Deter Them, 2011 (8), pp. 16-19; (2014) Red October Diplomatic Cyber-Attacks Investigation, , http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792262/Red_October_Diplomatic_Cyber_Attacks_Investigation; (2013) Apt1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, , Technical Report, Mandiant; Ronald, D., Rafal, R., Tracking ghost net: Investigating a cyber-espionage network (2009) Inf.

Nevertheless, its highly virtualized environment is vulnerable to cyber attacks such as emerging Advanced Persistent Threats attack. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of cyber risk management for the fog computing platform. Particularly, we adopt the cyber-insurance as a tool for neutralizing cyber risks from fog computing platform. We consider a fog computing platform containing a group of fog nodes. The platform is composed of three main entities, i.e., the fog computing provider, attacker, and cyber-insurer. The fog computing provider dynamically optimizes the allocation of its defense computing resources to improve the security of the fog computing platform. Meanwhile, the attacker dynamically adjusts the allocation of its attack resources to improve the probability of successful attack. Additionally, to prevent from the potential loss due to attacks, the provider also makes a dynamic decision on the purchases ratio of cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer for each fog node. Thereafter, the cyber-insurer accordingly determines the premium of cyber-insurance for each fog node. In our formulated dynamic Stackelberg game, the attacker and provider act as the followers, and the cyber-insurer acts as the leader. In the lower level, we formulate an evolutionary subgame to analyze the provider's defense and cyber-insurance subscription strategies as well as the attacker's attack strategy. In the upper level, the cyber-insurer optimizes its premium determination strategy, taking into account the evolutionary equilibrium at the lower-level evolutionary subgame. We analytically prove that the evolutionary equilibrium is unique and stable. Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the dynamic Stackelberg game. © 2018 IEEE.","Advanced Persistent Threats attacks; cyber-insurace; fog computing; game theory; Risk management","Computation theory; Computer crime; Computer games; Fog; Game theory; Insurance; Network security; Risk management; Virtual reality; Advanced Persistent Threats attacks; Computing platform; Computing resource; cyber-insurace; Evolutionary equilibriums; Numerical results; Premium determination; Virtualized environment; Fog computing",,,,,"2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17, M4082187 (4080, MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15, NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277, NRF2017EWT-EP003-041

Inspired by the excellent characteristics of MXenes when used as substrate materials and recent experiments of depositing metal nanoparticles on MXenes, we systematically investigated monolayer metal thin films decorated by Mo2C (MXene) (MML/Mo2C, M = Cu, Pd, Pt, Ag and Au) as ORR catalysts using density functional theory. According to the stability and adsorption properties, we speculate that AuML/Mo2C possesses outstanding ORR performance and enhanced durability in comparison with Pt/C catalysts. The ORR on AuML/Mo2C proceeds through a four-electron reduction pathway with comparable or even better activity than Pt(1 0 0), Pt(1 1 1) and commercial Pt/C catalysts both kinetically and thermodynamically. Strong metal-support interactions give rise to larger electronic perturbations in the supported Au monolayer in contact with Mo2C, which strengthen the adsorption of oxygen-containing species and enhance the catalytic activity. Our current results indicate that AuML/Mo2C is a promising ORR catalyst candidate to replace precious Pt/C catalysts due to its good stability, enhanced durability, low cost and high activity. We hope our results will inspire more experimental and theoretical research to further design, explore and apply advanced metal monolayer-supported MXene composites. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","density functional theory; high activity and corrosion-resistant electrocatalyst; metal monolayers; MXene-based catalyst; oxygen reduction reaction","Corrosion resistance; Costs; Density functional theory; Deposition; Durability; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Films; Fuel cells; Gas adsorption; Metal nanoparticles; Monolayers; Oxygen; Platinum metals; Corrosion-resistant; Electronic perturbations; Four-electron reduction; Large-scale applications; Metal monolayers; Oxygen reduction reaction; Oxygen-containing species; Strong metal support interaction; Catalyst activity",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 11474086, 11874141","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 11874141 and 11474086).

In this paper, cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is applied to study the interactions between a cyber system and an APT attacker when each of them makes subjective decisions to choose their scan interval and attack interval, respectively. Both the probability distortion effect and the framing effect are applied to model the deviation of subjective decisions of end-users from the objective decisions governed by expected utility theory, under uncertain attack durations in a pure-strategy game and scan interval in a mixed-strategy game. The CPT-based APT detection game incorporates both the probability weighting distortion and the framing effect of the subjective attacker and security agent of the cyber system, rather than discrete decision weights, as in earlier prospect theoretic study of APT detection. The Nash equilibria of the APT detection game are derived, showing that a subjective attacker becomes risk-seeking if the frame of reference for evaluating the utility is large, and becomes risk-averse if the frame of reference for evaluating the utility is small. A policy hill-climbing (PHC) based detection scheme is proposed to increase the policy uncertainty to fool the attacker in the dynamic game, and a 'hotbooting' technique that exploits experiences in similar scenarios to initialize the quality values is developed to accelerate the learning speed of PHC-based detection. A practical example of a mobile network is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed detection strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can improve detection performance with a higher data protection level and utilities of the cloud in the presence of an attacker compared with a standard Q-learning strategy. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","advanced persistent threat; cumulative prospect theory; data protection; game theory; Reinforcement learning","Computation theory; Computer games; Data privacy; Decision theory; Distortion (waves); Mobile computing; Reinforcement learning; Security of data; Uncertainty analysis; advanced persistent threat; Computational model; Cumulative prospect theory; Games; Security; Uncertainty; Game theory",,,,,"ACI-1541069, CMMI-1435778, ECCS-1549881, ECCS-1647198

Mechanisms underlying AF are complex and remain incompletely understood despite extensive research. They associate interactions between triggers, substrate and modulators including ionic and anatomic remodeling, genetic predisposition and neuro-humoral contributors. The pulmonary veins play a key role in the pathogenesis of AF and their isolation is associated to high rates of AF freedom in patients with paroxysmal AF. However, ablation of persistent AF remains less effective, mainly limited by the difficulty to identify the sources sustaining AF. Many theories were advanced to explain the perpetuation of this form of AF, ranging from a single localized focal and reentrant source to diffuse bi-atrial multiple wavelets. Translating these mechanisms to the clinical practice remains challenging and limited by the spatio-temporal resolution of the mapping techniques. AF is driven by focal or reentrant activities that are initially clustered in a relatively limited atrial surface then disseminate everywhere in both atria. Evidence for structural remodeling, mainly represented by atrial fibrosis suggests that reentrant activities using anatomical substrate are the key mechanism sustaining AF. These reentries can be endocardial, epicardial, and intramural which makes them less accessible for mapping and for ablation. Subsequently, early interventions before irreversible remodeling are of major importance. Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of the treatment of AF, regardless of the AF form and of the AF duration. No ablation strategy consistently demonstrated superiority to pulmonary vein isolation in preventing long term recurrences of atrial arrhythmias. Further research that allows accurate identification of the mechanisms underlying AF and efficient ablation should improve the results of PsAF ablation.

This peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transaction framework benefits the end users, financially and in term of energy security; and the network operators, in term of flexibility in DRES management, peak load shifting and regulation of voltage/frequency. Environmentally, P2P energy transaction also helps to reduce carbon footprint, reduces DRES payback period and incentivizes the installation of DRES. The current centralized market model is no longer suitable and it is therefore necessary to develop an adapted decentralized architecture for the advanced P2P energy transaction framework intra/inter-micro grid. In this paper, we discuss several distributed ledger approaches for such framework: Blockchain, Block Lattice and Directed Acyclic Graph (the Tangle).

To address this issue, a security policy of big data analysis has been proposed based on the analysis of log data of servers and terminals in Spark. However, in practical applications, Spark cannot suitably analyze very huge amounts of log data. To address this problem, we propose a scheduling optimization technique based on the reuse of datasets to improve Spark performance. In this technique, we define and formulate the reuse degree of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Spark based on Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then, we define a global optimization function to obtain the optimal DAG sequence, that is, the sequence with the least execution time. To implement the global optimization function, we further propose a novel cost optimization algorithm based on the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our experiments demonstrate that this scheduling optimization technique in Spark can greatly decrease the time overhead of analyzing log data for detecting APT attacks. © 2018 Tsinghua University Press.","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG); Genetic Algorithm (GA); Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD); reuse; schedule; Spark","Directed graphs; Electric sparks; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Graph theory; Scheduling; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Directed acyclic graphs; Optimization function; Resilient distributed dataset; reuse; Scheduling optimization; Traditional genetic algorithms; Big data",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61379144, 61501482, 61572026, 61672195","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61379144, 61572026, 61672195, and 61501482) and the Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Cryptology.",,"Chen, P., Desmet, L., Huygens, C., A study on advanced persistent threats (2014) Proc. 15th IFIP TC 6/TC 11 Int.

Based on a sample composed of ISO 14001 certified companies in Indonesia, and analyzing the data using consistent Partial Least Squares (PLSc), we found that: the CEP-CFP relationship follows an inverted U-shape; advanced eco-learning is a significant predictor of the CEP-CFP relationship, meaning that organizations able to develop higher eco-learning capability will be better able to identify the ideal boundaries of investment in environmental performance without reducing their financial performance; and that contingency factors such as environmental strategy and firm size have a significant role in influencing the CEP-CFP relationship. The study's limitations, implications for practitioners and a future research agenda are also detailed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced eco-learning; Contingency factors; Environmental accounting; Environmental performance; Financial performance","accountability; advanced technology; corporate strategy; environmental economics; environmental management; factor analysis; finance; firm size; investment; learning; least squares method; natural resource; performance assessment; article; human; Indonesia; investment; learning; organization; partial least squares regression; physician; environmental protection; forecasting; natural resource; organization; Indonesia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forecasting; Indonesia; Natural Resources; Organizations",,,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., Ramani, R.S., Alabduliader, N., What you see is what you get?

When the APT has been detected, the organization has to deal with the APT response problem, i.e., to allocate the available response resources to fix her insecure hosts so as to mitigate her potential loss. This paper addresses the APT response problem by using the risk management approach. First, we introduce a model characterizing the evolution of the organization&#x0027;s expected state. By analyzing this model, we find the organization&#x0027;s expected state approaches a common limit expected state. Then, we use the organization&#x0027;s expected loss per unit time to measure her potential loss, and we find this measure is determined by the organization&#x0027;s limit expected state. On this basis, we model the APT response problem as a game-theoretic problem (the APT response game) in which the organization seeks a Nash equilibrium. We present a greedy algorithm for solving the game. Comparative experiments show that the algorithm is effective. Therefore, we recommend the response strategy generated by performing the algorithm. These findings contribute to defending against the APT. To our knowledge, this is the first time the APT response problem is addressed.

Bachelet 12, Rome, 00185, Italy","This paper focuses on the application of Advanced Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (A-DInSAR) to subsidence-related issues, with particular reference to ground settlements due to external loads. Beyond the stratigraphic setting and the geotechnical properties of the subsoil, other relevant boundary conditions strongly influence the reliability of remotely sensed data for quantitative analyses and risk mitigation purposes. Because most of the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) measurement points (Persistent Scatterers, PSs) lie on structures and infrastructures, the foundation type and the age of a construction are key factors for a proper interpretation of the time series of ground displacements. To exemplify a methodological approach to evaluate these issues, this paper refers to an analysis carried out in the coastal/deltaic plain west of Rome (Rome and Fiumicino municipalities) affected by subsidence and related damages to structures. This region is characterized by a complex geological setting (alternation of recent deposits with low and high compressibilities) and has been subjected to different urbanisation phases starting in the late 1800s, with a strong acceleration in the last few decades. The results of A-DInSAR analyses conducted from 1992 to 2015 have been interpreted in light of high-resolution geological/geotechnical models, the age of the construction, and the types of foundations of the buildings on which the PSs are located. Collection, interpretation, and processing of geo-thematic data were fundamental to obtain high-resolution models; change detection analyses of the land cover allowed us to classify structures/infrastructures in terms of the construction period. Additional information was collected to define the types of foundations, i.e., shallow versus deep foundations. As a result, we found that only by filtering and partitioning the A-DInSAR datasets on the basis of the above-mentioned boundary conditions can the related time series be considered a proxy of the consolidation process governing the subsidence related to external loads as confirmed by a comparison with results from a physically based back analysis based on Terzaghi's theory. Therefore, if properly managed, the A-DInSAR data represents a powerful tool for capturing the evolutionary stage of the process for a single building and has potential for forecasting the behaviour of the terrain-foundation-structure combination. © 2018 by the authors.","Coastal Fiumicino plain; Geological model; Persistent scatterers; Subsidence; Urban settlement","Boundary conditions; Construction; Foundations; Interferometry; Landforms; Radar imaging; Risk analysis; Soils; Stratigraphy; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Change detection analysis; Coastal Fiumicino plain; Geological modeling; Geotechnical properties; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Persistent scatterers; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Urban settlement; Time series analysis",,,,,,,,"Sundell, J., Haaf, E., Norberg, T., Alén, C., Karlsson, M., Rosén, L., Risk Mapping of Groundwater-Drawdown-Induced Land Subsidence in Heterogeneous Soils on Large Areas (2017) Risk Anal; Bozzano, F., Esposito, C., Franchi, S., Mazzanti, P., Perissin, D., Rocca, A., Romano, E., Understanding the subsidence process of a quaternary plain by combining geological and hydrogeological modelling with satellite InSAR data: The Acque Albule Plain case study (2015) Remote Sens.

Unmanned systems operate with increasingly more advanced autonomy. According to the Defense Science Board report of 2012, the key aspect of enhancing autonomy is providing persistency. However, onboard fuel, in general, and battery capacity, for the electrically-powered systems in particular, limit the operational time of many systems characterized as persistent. That is why these days researchers explore a variety of solutions that have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the mission. These include using tethered systems, ground pads with contact and wireless (inductive) battery charging, solar-powered ground stations, power-line recharging stations, hydrogen fuel cells, solar-powered drones, laser-beam inflight recharging, etc. This paper focuses on the development and evaluation of simpler and seemingly more cost-efficient approach for a multi-rotor aerial persistent system enabling longer-duration missions using vehicle swapping and intelligent battery management. The developed prototype consists of three commercially available quadcopters, a wireless network router, and a laptop to execute Python code. System operation assumes autonomous operation swapping vehicles to maintain an airborne platform in the loiter area based on battery health. Based on analysis and assessment of the field test results, this paper proves the feasibility of the developed concept. For example, utilizing just four vehicle swaps the aerial surveillance platform was continuously available in the loiter area (on target) for about an hour, which is more than five times the air time of a single vehicle. While the field testing was conducted with a limited number of batteries, having nine batteries and chargers (for the particular commercial-off-the shelf system) would allow the developed system to operate for much longer durations, pretty much indefinitely. © 2018 IEEE.","battery life; mission endurance; multi-rotor aerial unmanned system; swapping","Charging (batteries); Control theory; Drones; Fuel cells; Laser beams; Mobile antennas; Robotics; Routers; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Aerial surveillance; Autonomous operations; Battery life; Battery Management; Commercial off-the-shelf systems; Defense Science Board; swapping; Unmanned system; Battery management systems",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the Office of Naval Research for supporting this effort through the CRUSER program.",,"Gettinger, D., Drone spending in the fiscal year 2017 defense budget Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, , dronecenter. bard. edu/files/2016/02/DroneSpendingFy17-CSD-1-1. pdf (accessed Dec 16, 2017), Annandale-on-Hudson, NY, Feb 2016; Holland, T., The 3d robotics solo: A dronelife review (2015) DroneLife, , dronelife. com/2015/07/30/the-3d-roboticssolo-a-dronelife-review (accessed Dec 16, 2017), July 30; (2012) The Role of Autonomy in DOD Systems, Task Force Report, DoD Defense Science Board, Office of the under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, , www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2010s/AutonomyReport.pdf, Washington, D.

To monitor this risk, various, accurate and efficient tools have been developed (e.g. Shiryaev in Theory Probab Appl 8(1):22–46, 1963; Roberts in Technometrics 8(3):411–430, 1966; Polunchenko and Tartakovsky in Ann Stat 38(6):3445–3457, 2010). A particular attention is usually spent on the detection of a change-point, i.e. the time where the level of mortality changes (El Karoui et al. in Minimax optimality in robust detection of a disorder time in poisson rate (working paper or preprint), 2015; Croix et al. in Bulletin Français d’Actuariat 15(29):75–112, 2015). A common assumption in all these works is that the distribution of the deaths is well known not only before the change-point but also after. In the present paper, we consider a parametric framework for the distribution after the changer and we suppose that we do not know its parameter after the change-point. Thus we focus on its estimation. Our method is derived from the sequential Shiryaev–Roberts procedure. The paper starts with a presentation of this procedure and our methodology in a general framework. We provide a specific Poisson model, designed here for the study of the mortality as in Rhodes and Freitas (Advanced statistical analysis of mortality. AFIR papers. Boston Colloquia. MIB inc., Westwood, 2004) and Planchet and Tomas (Insur Math Econ 63:169–190, 2015). Two versions are analysed: in the first one, we assume that the current mortality is stable and we look for a sudden but persistent change of level. In the second model, we introduce a new set-up: the mortality evolves at a steady pace and we look for a change of the trend. Variants of these approaches are also widely expressed and are compared to benchmark methodologies. An important part of this work is devoted to the application of our methodology on real data, in a context where the change is obvious, using specific methodologies to adjust the data as in Mei et al.

Researchers, however, have done little to address the risk of advanced persistent threat intrusions, specifically in regard to the use of rootkits, which are powerful, stealthy pieces of malware that have grown in popularity with cybercriminals and nation state actors. These programs threaten a system by acquiring root privilege and then, using a variety of stealth tactics, evading detection and removal by modern anti-malware tools. In this research, we validate that the approach of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Beholder project is applicable to the context of rootkit detection within a running virtual machine. We do this by collecting and analyzing system calls collected on the hypervisor level. The analysis employs a novel nonlinear, phase-space algorithm to derive time-serial cyber dynamics, and then uses these dynamics to characterize potentially anomalous system behavior through the comparison of nominal and test behavior profiles. Our results demonstrate that this technique is effective in flagging variance between the timing traces of an infected and an uninfected machine, thus indicating the presence of a running rootkit. © 2018 IEEE.","Cloud computing security; Cyber anomaly detection; Graph theory; Malware; Phase space analysis; Rootkits; Virtual machine","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer crime; Graph theory; Intrusion detection; Network security; Phase space methods; Virtual machine; Analyzing system; Anomaly detection; Cloud computing securities; Cybercriminals; Oak ridge National Laboratory; Phase-space analysis; Rootkit detections; System behaviors; Malware",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1564518, DUE-1241675

In this brief review, rather than focusing on the development of different musical techniques and practices over time, the main issues addressed here concern: (i) when, and speculations as to why, modern Homo sapiens evolved musical behaviors, (ii) the evolutionary relationship between music and language, and (iii) why humans, perhaps unique among all living species, universally continue to possess two complementary but distinct communication streams. Did music exist before language, or vice versa, or was there a common precursor that in some way separated into two distinct yet still overlapping systems when cognitively modern H. sapiens evolved? A number of theories put forward to explain the origin and persistent universality of music are considered, but emphasis is given, supported by recent neuroimaging, physiological, and psychological findings, to the role that music can play in promoting trust, altruistic behavior, social bonding, and cooperation within groups of culturally compatible but not necessarily genetically related humans. It is argued that, early in our history, the unique socializing and harmonizing power of music acted as an essential counterweight to the new and evolving sense of self, to an emerging sense of individuality and mortality that was linked to the development of an advanced cognitive capacity and articulate language capability. © 2018 Harvey.","Altruism; Dopamine; Evolution; Language; Motherese; Music; Oxytocin; Social cooperation",,,,,,,,,"Aboitiz, F., Garcia, R., Merging of phonological and gestural circuits in early language evolution (2009) Rev.

Despite their diversity in nature and details, a common skeleton and sequence of phases can be identified that these attacks follow (in similar ways), which admits a game-theoretic description and analysis. This paper describes a general framework that divides a general APT into three major temporal phases, and fits an individual game model to each phase, connecting the games at the transition points between the phases (similarly to ""milestones"" accomplished during the launch of an APT). The theoretical description is derived from a running example. The benefit of this game-theoretic perspective is at least threefold, as it 1) helps to systematize the threat and respective mitigation actions (by turning them into pure strategies for the gameplay); 2) provides optimized actions for defense and attack, where the latter can be taken as a (non-unique) indication of neuralgic points; and 3) provides quantitative measures of resilience against an APT, in terms that can be defined freely by a security officer. We illustrate this approach with a numerical example. © 2018 IEEE.","H.4.2.a decision support; I.2.1 applications and expert knowledge-intensive systems; K.6.5 security and protection","Command and control systems; Malware; Network layers; Ordnance; Game-theoretic perspectives; Games; Multi stage games; Physical layers; Quantitative measures; Security; Security officers; Security threats; Game theory",,,,,,,,"Farwell, J.P., Rohozinski, R., Stuxnet and the future of cyber war (2011) Survival, 53 (1), pp. 23-40; Bencsáth, B., Pék, G., Buttyán, L., Félegyházi, M., The Cousins of Stuxnet: Duqu, flame, and gauss (2012) Future Internet, 4 (4), pp. 971-1003; Munro, K., Deconstructing Flame: The limitations of traditional defences (2012) Comput.

Herein experimental and in silico approaches were adopted to obtain kOH values for a variety of OPEs. The determined kOH for 18 OPEs varies from 4.0 × 108 M-1 s-1 to 1.6 × 1010 M-1 s-1. Based on the experimental kOH values, a quantitative structure-activity relationship model that involves molecular structural information on the number of heavy atoms, content index, and the most negative charge of C atoms was developed for predicting kOH of other OPEs. Furthermore, appropriate density functional theory (DFT) and solvation models were selected, which together with transition state theory were employed to predict kOH of three representative OPEs. The deviation between the DFT calculated and the experimental kOH values (kcal/kexp) is within 2. Half-lives of the OPEs were estimated to be 0.5-22791.3 days in natural waters and 0.044-19.7 s in AOPs, indicating the OPEs are potentially persistent in natural waters and can be quickly eliminated by AOPs. The determined kOH values and the in silico methods offer a scientific base for assessing OPEs fate in aquatic environments. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalyst activity; Density functional theory; Flame retardants; Free radicals; Potash; Reaction kinetics; Reaction rates; Solvents; Advanced oxidation process; Aquatic environments; Molecular structural; OH radical reaction rate constants; Organophosphate esters; Organophosphorus flame retardants; Quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling; Transition state theories; Rate constants; flame retardant; hydroxyl radical; organophosphorus compound; plasticizer; organophosphate; plasticizer; aquatic environment; environmental fate; experimental study; flame retardant; hydroxyl radical; modeling; organophosphate; oxidation; pollutant removal; reaction rate; aquatic environment; aqueous solution; Article; computer model; density functional theory; prediction; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum chemistry; solvation; ultraviolet spectroscopy; environmental monitoring; oxidation reduction reaction; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Organophosphates; Oxidation-Reduction; Plasticizers",,"hydroxyl radical, 3352-57-6; Flame Retardants; Organophosphates; Plasticizers",,,"University of Minnesota, UM

We present an illustrative case of an HIV-infected but virologically suppressed patient who complained of visual impairment accompanied by severe headache and epileptic seizures. The cerebral CT scan and the follow-up cranial MRI confirmed the diagnosis of PRES. Unlike the cases of HIV-infected patients with PRES published so far, our patient suffered neither from advanced immunodeficiency nor from opportunistic infection or from any other evident predisposing factor. This case highlights that the absence of classical risk factors does not exclude the diagnosis of PRES. We discuss the hypothesis that in accordance with the new pathophysiological theory, persistent HIV-associated cerebrovascular reactivity in combination with endothelial dysfunction may represent an undetected risk factor for the development of PRES in virologically and immunologically stable patients. © BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Here the paper questions the widespread assumption that religion will be radically different from modern ethics (“economics as ethics”) in the tradition of the Scottish Enlightenment. In this regard the paper specifically addresses the call for a concept of “rational religion” as early on identified by Smith but contests the explicit claims of Smith or modern institutional economists like Buchanan that a concept of rational religion or “economics as ethics” necessarily is separated from the Bible. An institutional economic theory of Old Testament-based religion is proposed through a set of four theses. On the basis of these arguments, the paper outlines why Old Testament-based religion still has and could have a persistent and pervasive influence in contemporary, capitalist society. © 2018 The Editors of the Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament.","(Rejection of) dualism thesis; Economic pattern thesis; Institutional economic theory of religion; New unitary thesis; Old testament; Institutional/constitutional economics; Pervasiveness/persistence of religion thesis; Rational religion",,,,,,,,,"Kuran, T., Religious Economics and the Economics of Religion (1994) Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics, 150, p. 774; Elzinga, K.G., Economics and Religion (1999) Religion and Economics: Normative Social Theory, p. 139. , James M.

Isolation and diversity are key techniques of cyber resilience for creating built-in resistance in cyber networks against the lateral movement of multi-step Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and epidemic attacks. However, the key unaddressed challenges are (1) how to ensure that specific isolation and diversity configurations are sufficient to prevent the lateral movement of attacks and (2) how to verify that such configurations are enforced safely despite the complex inter-dependency between cyber components. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing formal models and properties to verify the effectiveness and enforceability of proactive cyber resistance techniques. We present a bounded model checking approach based on satisfiability Modulo theories (SMT) for OpenFlow software defined networks (SDNs). We verify that given resistance techniques are enforced in a way that does not violate the cyber mission requirements and we evaluate the configuration resistance based on user-defined resistance properties.

Firstly, this paper analyzed the attack paths of attackers and proposed the defensive framework of network security by analyzing the characteristics of the APT attack and the distributed network structure. Secondly, OAPG(an attack path prediction model oriented to APT) was established from the value both the attacker and the defender based on game theory, besides, this paper calculated the game equilibrium and generated the maximum revenue path of the attacker, and then put forward the best defensive strategy for defender. Finally, this paper validated the model by an instance of APT attack, the calculated results showed that the model can rational analyze the attacker and defender from the attack path, and can provide a reasonable defense scheme for organizations that use distributed networks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,"Game theory; Predictive analytics; Attack path; Defensive strategies; Distributed network structures; Distributed networks; Game equilibrium; Game models; Maximum revenue; Problem-based; Network security",,,,,,,,"Rass, S., Zhu, Q., GADAPT: A sequential game-theoretic framework for designing defense-in-depth strategies against advanced persistent threats (2016) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security, pp. 314-326. , Springer; Cutler, T., The anatomy of an advanced persistent threat (2010) Wired Business Media, , [database online]; Feng, X., Zheng, Z., Hu, P., Stealthy attacks meets insider threats: a three-player game model (2015) 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2015, pp. 25-30. , IEEE; Rass, S., König, S., Schauer, S., Defending against advanced persistent threats using game-theory (2017) PLoS ONE, 12 (1), p. e0168675; Singh, S., Sharma, P.K., Moon, S.Y., A comprehensive study on APT attacks and countermeasures for future networks and communications: challenges and solutions (2016) J.

The purpose of these attacks varies from long period espionage in high level environment to causing maximal destruction for targeted cyber environment. Attackers are skilful and well funded by governments in many cases. Due to sophisticated methods it is highly important to study proper countermeasures to detect these attacks as early as possible. Current detection methods under-performs causing situations where an attack can continue months or even years in a targeted environment. We propose a novel method for analysing APT attacks through OODA loop and Black Swan theory by defining them as a multi-vector multi-stage attacks with continuous strategical ongoing campaign. Additionally it is important to notice that for developing better performing detection methods, we have to find the most common factor within these attacks. We can state that the most common factor of APT attacks is communication, thus environment has to be developed in a way that we are able to capture complete network flow and analyse it. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Advanced Persistent Thread (APT); Black Swan theory; Network anomaly detection; OODA loop","Electric current measurement; Advanced Persistent Thread (APT); Black Swan theory; Complete networks; Detection methods; Digital infrastructures; Multi-stage attack; Network anomaly detection; OODA loop; Computation theory",,,,,,,,"Brogi, G., Tong, V.V.T., TerminAPTor: Highlighting Advanced Persistent Threats through information flow tracking (2016) 2016 8Th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS), , https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2016.7792480; Vukalović, J., Delija, D., Advanced Persistent Threats-detection and defense (2015) 2015 38Th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO), pp. 1324-1330. , https://doi.org/10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160480; Chandran, S., Hrudya, P., Poornachandran, P., An efficient classification model for detecting Advanced Persistent Threat (2015) 2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI), pp. 2001-2009. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275911; Settanni, G., Shovgenya, Y., Skopik, F., Graf, R., Wurzenberger, M., Fiedler, R., Acquiring cyber threat intelligence through security information correlation (2017) 2017 3Rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF), , https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBConf.2017.7985754; Hu, P., Li, H., Fu, H., Cansever, D., Mohapatra, P., Dynamic defense strategy against Advanced Persistent Threat with insiders (2015) 2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), pp. 747-755. , https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218444; Ussath, M., Jaeger, D., Cheng, F., Advanced Persistent Threats: Behind the scenes (2016) 2016 Annual Conference on Information Science and Systems (CISS), , https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2016.7460498; Messaoud, B., Guennoun, K., Wahbi, M., Sadik, M., Advanced Persistent Threat: New analysis driven by life cycle phases and their challenges (2016) 2016 International Conference on Advanced Communication Systems and Information Security (ACOSIS), , https://doi.org/10.1109/ACOSIS.2016.7843932; Bhatt, P., Yano, E.T., Gustavsson, P.M., Towards a framework to detect multi-stage Advanced Persistent Threats attacks (2014) 2014 IEEE 8Th International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering, pp. 390-395. , https://doi.org/10.1109/SOSE.2014.53; Vance, A., Flow based analysis of Advanced Persistent Threats detecting targeted attacks in cloud computing (2014) 2014 First International Scientific-Practical Conference Problems of Infocommunications Science and Technology, pp. 173-176. , https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOMMST.2014.6992342; Xiao, L., Xu, D., Mandayam, N.B., Poor, H.V., Attacker-centric view of a detection game against Advanced Persistent Threats (2018) IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, , https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2018.2814052; Eidle, D., Ni, S.Y., Decusatis, C., Sager, A., Autonomic security for zero trust networks (2017) 2017 IEEE 8Th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON), , https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249053; Zhu, Q., Rass, S., On multi-phase and multi-stage game-theoretic modeling of Advanced Persistent Threats (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 13958-13971. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2814481; Taleb, N., (2007) The Black Swan: The Impact of The Highly Improbable.

Transgenders, robots, сlones have been increasingly involved in social community and, thus, contributed to profound normative morphogenesis in the contemporary society. Consequently, there is a challenging primordial heteronormativity with some fundamental ascriptive binaries evident in transgressive confusion of the following oppositions: between human and subhuman (e.g. legitimation of animal or fetal rights); between cultural and natural (cyborgs); between animate and inanimate (android robots); between corporeal and incorporeal (virtual, ‘augmented’ and ‘mixed’ reality). A range of practices related to such transgression can be considered as trans-mobility that implies various self-determined individual transitions from the former ascribed position to a new transitive one and external transpositions due to forced alteration of individual or collective statuses/identities. The article considers three typical modes of morphological trans-mobility to identify the most important arrays the ontological binaries are de-ascribed in: visceral trans-mobility pertaining to all possible options to modify human corporality (including radical body modification); conversional trans-mobility beyond the line between life and death, being and nonbeing, corporeal (material) and incorporeal (immaterial) ontology (from bitcoins to clones); prosopopoeian trans-mobility involving initially non-social creatures into active social life (from pets to robots). The author seeks to answer the question of how current normative morphogenesis is embedded into social-normative order. Based on the theory of recognition, the article considers morphotaxis (an opposite of morphogenesis) as a latent compensatory mechanism to maintain the primordial social order by persistent reproduction of heteronormativity. Based on some empirical data, the author shows that dichotomized sexual (male—female), genetical (sexual—asexual) and biological (animate—inanimate) patterns with corresponding social norms still constitute the morphological foundation of the primordial social order despite the advanced post-human practices. © I.V.

When an APT has been detected, the target organization has to develop a response resource allocation strategy to mitigate her potential loss. This paper suggests a risk management approach to solving this APT response problem. First, we present three state evolution models. Thereby we assess the organization’s potential loss. On this basis, we propose two kinds of game-theoretic models of the APT response problem.

The multi-stage Bayesian game captures the incomplete information of the players’ type, and enables an adaptive belief update according to the observable history of the other player’s actions. The solution concept of perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) under the proactive and reactive information structures of the players provides an important analytical tool to predict and design the players’ behavior. To capture the learning process and enable fast computation of PBNE, we use conjugate priors to update the beliefs of the players parametrically, which is assimilated into backward dynamic programming with an expanded state space. We use a mathematical programming approach to compute the PBNE of the dynamic bi-matrix game of incomplete information. In the case study, we analyze and study two PBNEs under complete and one-sided incomplete information. The results reveal the benefit of deception of the private attackers’ types and motivate defender’s use of deception techniques to tilt the information asymmetry. Numerical results have been used to corroborate the analytical findings of our framework and show the effectiveness of defense design to deter the attackers and mitigate the APTs strategically. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs); Cyber deception; Multistage Bayesian game; Optimal learning; Proactive and strategic defense","Computation theory; Cyber Physical System; Decision theory; Dynamic programming; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Network security; Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs); Bayesian game; Cyber deception; Optimal learning; Proactive and strategic defense; Game theory",,,,,,,,"Basar, T., Olsder, G.J., (1999) Dynamic Noncooperative Game Theory, 23. , Siam, Philadelphia; Bathelt, A., Ricker, N.L., Jelali, M., Revision of the tennessee eastman process model (2015) Ifac-Papersonline, 48 (8), pp. 309-314; Cárdenas, A.A., Baras, J.S., Seamon, K., A framework for the evaluation of intrusion detection systems (2006) 2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, p. 15. , IEEE; Cole, E., (2012) Advanced Persistent Threat: Understanding the Danger and How to Protect Your Organization, , Newnes, Oxford; Harsanyi, J.C., Games with incomplete information played by “Bayesian” players, i-iii part i.

In each stage of the attack, the adversary gathers more privileges, resources, and information about the system and uses this information to gain access to the targeted data of the next stage to reach the final goal. APTs are not only persistent but also stealthy and hence difficult to detect. The persistent nature of APTs, however, creates information flows in the system that can be monitored. One monitoring mechanism is Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT), which taints and tracks malicious information flows through a system and inspects the flows at designated traps. Since tainting all flows in the system will incur prohibitive resource costs, efficient tagging policies are needed to decide which flows to tag in order to maximize the probability of APT detection while minimizing resource overhead. At present such an analytical model for DIFT for multi-stage APT detection does not exist. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework modeling real-time detection of multi-stage APTs via DIFT. We formulate a two-player (APT vs DIFT) nonzero-sum stochastic game with incomplete information to obtain an optimal tagging policy. Our game model consists of a sequence of stages, where each stage of the game corresponds to a stage in the attack. At each stage, the goal of the APT is to reach a particular destination, corresponding to a targeted resource or privilege, while the goal of the defender is to detect the APT. We first derive an efficient algorithm to find locally optimal strategies for both players. We then characterize the best responses of both players and present algorithms to find the best responses. Finally, we validate our results on a real-world attack data set obtained using the Refinable Attack INvestigation (RAIN) framework for a ScreenGrab attack. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Decision theory; Stochastic systems; Dynamic information flow tracking; Incomplete information; Information flows; Monitoring mechanisms; Nonzero-sum stochastic games; Optimal strategies; Real-time detection; Real-world attack; Game theory",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-16-1-2710 P00002","This work was supported by ONR grant N00014-16-1-2710 P00002",,"Bencsáth, B., Pék, G., Buttyán, L., Felegyhazi, M., The cousins of Stuxnet: Duqu, Flame, and Gauss (2012) Future Internet, 4 (4), pp. 971-1003; Bhatt, P., Yano, E.T., Gustavsson, P., Towards a framework to detect multi-stage advanced persistent threats attacks (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering, Oxford, United Kingdom, pp. 390-395; Buchbinder, N., Feldman, M., Seffi, J., Schwartz, R., A tight linear time (1/2)-approximation for unconstrained submodular maximization (2015) SIAM J.

The two-level framework adapted facilitates abstraction of the complexity of process level interactions between defense mechanisms and adversaries from easier to interpret and more flexible system-level interaction. At the process-level, program anomaly detection algorithms have already been proposed to detect anomalous program behavior by comparing monitored activities with the predetermined expected behavior. This had led to significant detection performance initially until advanced adversaries modified the attacks to remain undetected. Therefore, we propose defense mechanisms that anticipate the reaction of advanced evaders and seek to maximize the complexity of undetectable attacks at the expense of additional false alarm rate. Furthermore, in the system-level, we propose defense mechanisms to detect adversarial intervention across processes through the assessment of all process activities together in a cohesive way so that the advanced adversaries need to craft their attacks further to remain undetected also at the system-level. This further increases the cost of complexity for the attacker, and correspondingly degrades the motivation to attack. We provide a game theoretical incentive analysis for both defenders and adversaries, and characterize pure and mixed strategy equilibria. We also analyze the coupling between the two levels of the game. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced persistent threats; Anomaly detection; Games-in-games; Host-based intrusion detection; Mimicry attacks; Process monitoring; Stackelberg games","Decision theory; Intrusion detection; Network security; Process monitoring; Advanced persistent threats; Anomaly detection; Games-in-games; Host-based intrusion detection; Mimicry attacks; Stackelberg Games; Game theory",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-16-1-2710","Keywords: Host-based intrusion detection · Mimicry attacks Games-in-games · Anomaly detection · Process monitoring Stackelberg games · Advanced persistent threats M.

One class of cyber-attack is advanced persistent threats where highly skilled attackers can steal user authentication information and then move laterally in the network, from host to host in a hidden manner until they reach an attractive target. The security modeling process of CPSs is divided into two phases of intrusion and disruption. In each phase, a game-theoretic paradigm with different parameters predicts the interactions between the attacker and the system. By solving the model, the security of CPSs is estimated in terms of probability of attack and probability of defend. After getting those the attackers and defenders can take optimized actions to maximize their gains. Most importantly, defender/systems can tune the system parameters to mitigate the attack. © 2018 Society for Modeling and Simulation (SCS) International.","Cyber-physical systems; Game theory; Mixed strategy","Authentication; Crime; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Game theory; Information use; Network security; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Game-theoretic; Information and Communication Technologies; Mixed strategy; Probability of attack; Security games; Security model; User authentication; Computer crime",,,,,,,,"Bronk, C., Tikk-Ringas, E., (2013) Hack Or Attack?

In order to effectively prevent and respond to compound attacks, a method of cyber-attack prediction based on threat intelligence is proposed. Firstly, a threat intelligence matching method is used to extract high-quality threat intelligence from the external threat intelligence, and then predicting the attack behavior based on the context data in high-quality threat intelligence. In the absence of high-quality threat intelligence, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is used to predict the attack behavior.

As APTs use sophisticated attack methods, cyber situational awareness and especially cyber attack attribution are necessary for the preservation of security of cyber infrastructures. Recent challenges faced by organizations in the light of APT proliferation are related to the: collection of APT knowledge; monitoring of APT activities; detection and classification of APTs; and correlation of all these to result in the attribution of the malicious parties that orchestrated an attack. We propose the Enhanced Cyber Attack Attribution (NEON) Framework, which performs attribution of malicious parties behind APT campaigns. NEON is designed to increase societal resiliency to APTs. NEON combines the following functionalities: (i) data collection from APT campaigns; (ii) collection of publicly available data from social media; (iii) honeypots and virtual personas; (iv) network and system behavioural monitoring; (v) incident detection and classification; (vi) network forensics; (vii) dynamic response based on game theory; and (viii) adversarial machine learning; all designed with privacy considerations in mind. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",,"Crime; Digital forensics; Game theory; Learning systems; Neon; Network security; Attack methods; Cyber infrastructures; Cyber-attacks; Data collection; Honeypots; Incident detection; Situational awareness; Social media; Computer crime",,,,,,,,"Farinholt, B., To catch a ratter: Monitoring the behavior of amateur Dark-Comet RAT operators in the wild (2017) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 770-787. , IEEE; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) 4Th ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-58. , ACM; Pfleeger, S.L., Sasse, M.A., Furnham, A., From weakest link to security hero: Transforming staff security behavior (2014) J.

However, while organizations like SANS and ISO have made efforts to standardize the incident response process, the facts that nearly 50 % of victims learn of breaches through third party last year and that the median dwell time of attackers inside networks is 99 days demonstrate that incident response still shows poor outcomes. This paper aims at improving the incident response process by studying how cognitive biases can affect decision-making in the cyber realm. Notably, we will discuss how the base rate fallacy leads to a higher rate of false positives assertions. We will show how, in turn, this high number of false positives can cause a confirmation bias, reinforced by incentives to avoid thoroughly investigating leads. Finally, we will discuss hindsight bias, which can further taint the effectiveness of the incident analysis process, especially when results are difficult to observe. This paper argues that these cognitive biases negatively influence the performance of cyber incident response in a manner that is similar to how they have affected the performance of intelligence analysis in the past. As such, the paper proposes the adoption of solutions that emerged from the intelligence sector to address these problems, in particular the use of contrarian analysis techniques and structured analysis techniques. In exploring contrarian analysis techniques, we discuss the devil's advocate process, in which another analyst must argue the opposite view with the same evidence, and show how it can combat these biases. For structured analysis techniques, we discuss the competing hypothesis technique, in which the analyst must attempt to refute his own hypothesis, which is only confirmed if he fails to refute it. We discuss how such structured analysis can, not only combat cognitive biases, but also guide further investigations by identifying evidence that would unequivocally disprove hypotheses. The paper will also point out how rearranging incentives can promote the detection of threats. This will be illustrated by discussing the current trend to staff so-called threat hunting positions, which biases toward acknowledging the presence of threats, and whose performance are evaluated based on the numbers of threats they find rather than on the absence of observable incidents. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Then we build a prototype attack using these public services and experimentally confirm its effectiveness, including an average data transfer rate of 361 bits per second. Finally, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a proof-of-concept defense that uses information-theoretic entropy of the DNS queries to detect this novel attack. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Advanced persistent threats; Covert channel; Data exfiltration; Security","Data transfer; Data transfer rates; HTTP; Information theory; Internet protocols; Websites; Advanced persistent threats; Covert channels; Data exfiltration; Proof of concept; Public services; Security; Web services",,,,,"2018YFB1003201

Advances in networking techniques such as host migration of instances, mobile ad hoc networking, and distributed computing, bring in to question whether architectures can actually support a virtual world. Without a concrete definition, controversy ensues and it is problematic to design an architecture for a virtual world. Several researchers provided a definition but aspects of each definition are still problematic and simply can not be applied to contemporary technologies. The approach of this article is to sample technologies using grounded theory and to obtain a definition for a “virtual world” that is directly applicable to technology. The obtained definition is compared with related work and used to classify advanced technologies such as a pseudo-persistent video game, a MANet, virtual and mixed reality, and the Metaverse. The results of this article include a break down of which properties set apart the various technologies; a definition that is validated by comparing it with other definitions; an ontology showing the relation of the different complimentary terms and acronyms; and the usage of pseudo-persistence to categories those technologies, which only mimic persistence.

Developments concerning the IoT and CPS will improve critical infrastructure, vehicle networks, and personal health products. Unfortunately, these systems are vulnerable to attack. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a class of long-term attacks in which well-resourced adversaries infiltrate a network and use obfuscation to remain undetected. In a CPS under APTs, each device must decide whether to trust other components that may be compromised. In this paper, we propose a concept of trust (strategic trust) that uses game theory to capture the adversarial and strategic nature of CPS security. Specifically, we model an interaction between the administrator of a cloud service, an attacker, and a device that decides whether to trust signals from the vulnerable cloud. Our framework consists of a simultaneous signaling game and the FlipIt game. The equilibrium outcome in the signaling game determines the incentives in the FlipIt game. In turn, the equilibrium outcome in the FlipIt game determines the prior probabilities in the signaling game. The Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) characterizes the steady state of the overall macro-game. The novel contributions of this paper include proofs of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE. We also apply GNEs to strategically design a trust mechanism for a cloud-assisted insulin pump. Without requiring the use of historical data, the GNE obtains a risk threshold beyond which the pump should not trust messages from the cloud. Our framework contributes to a modeling paradigm called games-of-games. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","cyber-physical systems; cyber-security; Internet of things; perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium; signaling game; trust","Computation theory; Embedded systems; Game theory; Internet of things; Signaling; Trusted computing; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Internet of thing (IOT); Modeling paradigms; Prior probability; Signaling game; trust; Cyber Physical System",,,,,,,,"Swan, M., Sensor mania! the Internet of Things, wearable computing, objective metrics, and the quantified self 2. 0 (2012) J Sens.

In this paper, cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is applied to study the interactions between a defender of cloud storage and an APT attacker when each of them makes subjective decisions to choose the scan interval and attack interval, respectively. Both the probability weighting effect and the framing effect are applied to model the deviation of subjective decisions of end-users from the objective decisions governed by expected utility theory, under uncertain attack durations. Cumulative decision weights are used to describe the probability weighting effect and the value distortion functions are used to represent the framing effect of subjective APT attackers and defenders in the CPT-based APT defense game, rather than discrete decision weights, as in earlier prospect theoretic study of APT defense. The Nash equilibria of the CPT-based APT defense game are derived, showing that a subjective attacker becomes risk-seeking if the frame of reference for evaluating the utility is large, and becomes risk-averse if the frame of reference for evaluating the utility is small. © 2017 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threat; Cloud storage; Cumulative prospect theory; Game theory","Decision theory; Game theory; Virtual storage; Advanced persistent threat; Cloud storages; Cumulative prospect theory; Discrete decisions; Distortion functions; Expected utility theory; Frame of reference; Probability weighting; Network security",,,,,,,,"Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., Flipit: The game of stealthy takeover (2013) J.

Rapid increases in population and economic development have aggravated the situation. Monitoring and prediction of ground settlement is important to mitigate these hazards. In this study, we combined persistent-scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar with Grey system theory to monitor and predict land subsidence in the Beijing plain. Land subsidence during 2003–2014 was determined based on 39 ENVISAT advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) images and 27 RadarSat-2 images. Results were consistent with global positioning system, leveling measurements at the point level and TerraSAR-X subsidence maps at the regional level. The average deformation rate in the line-of-sight was from −124 to 7 mm/year. To predict future subsidence, the time-series deformation was used to build a prediction model based on an improved Grey-Markov model (IGMM), which adapted the conventional GM(1,1) model by utilizing rolling mechanism and integrating a k-means clustering method in Markov-chain state interval partitioning. Evaluation of the IGMM at both point level and regional scale showed good accuracy (root-mean-square error &lt;3 mm; R2 = 0.94 and 0.91). Finally, land subsidence in 2015–2016 was predicted, and the maximum cumulative deformation will reach 1717 mm by the end of 2016. The promising results indicate that this method can be used as an alternative to the conventional numerical and empirical models for short-term prediction when there is lack of detailed geological or hydraulic information. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Grey-Markov model; InSAR; k-means; Land subsidence","cluster analysis; deformation; environmental monitoring; ground settlement; groundwater exploration; Markov chain; prediction; radar interferometry; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; Beijing [China]; China",,,,,"Natural Environment Research Council, NERC: come30001

Yet the late twentieth-century intellectual ground was not fertile for his brand of social theory. By and large, nonquantitative social theory was no longer welcome in sociology departments. By opposing the ideology critique of the Frankfurt School tradition, Luhmann branded himself “conservative.” And, unlike the kinds of theory prevalent in the humanities (e.g., deconstruction), Luhmann never advanced his ideas with close readings of classical texts. Nevertheless, underneath the dissonance of the theoretical language that he used, the resonance with “postmodern” trends was profound, and a small but persistent cohort of scholars continues to engage in the literal and figurative translation of his work in the United States and the Commonwealth. © 2017 by New German Critique, Inc.","Critical theory; Frankfurt School; Grand theory; Poststructuralism",,,,,,,,,"Aronowitz, S., (2012) Thinking It Big: C.

At the physical layer, the device uses cloud services to operate the system. The quality of cloud services is unknown to the device, and hence the device designs a menu of contracts to enable a reliable and incentive-compatible service. Based on the received contracts, the cloud service provider (SP) serves the device by determining its optimal cyber defense strategy. A contract-based FlipCloud game is used to assess the security risk and the cloud quality of service (QoS) under advanced persistent threats. The contract design approach creates a pricing mechanism for on-demand security as a service for cloud-enabled IoCT. By focusing on high and low QoS types of cloud SPs, we find that the contract design can be divided into two regimes (regimes I and II) with respect to the provided cloud QoS. Specifically, the physical devices whose optimal contracts are in regime I always request the best possible cloud security service. In contrast, the device only asks for a cloud security level that can stabilize the system when the optimal contracts lie in regime II. We illustrate the obtained results via case studies of a cloud-enabled smart home. © 2017 IEEE.","advanced persistent threats; cloud computing; contract design; Internet of Controlled Things; Security as a service","Automation; Cloud computing; Computation theory; Distributed database systems; Intelligent buildings; Network layers; Network security; Risk assessment; Web services; Advanced persistent threats; Cloud service providers; Contract design; Holistic frameworks; Incentive compatible; Optimal contract; Pricing mechanism; Security as a services; Quality of service",,,,,,,,"Gubbi, J., Buyya, R., Marusic, S., Palaniswami, M., Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, future directions (2013) Future Generat.

Measurement tools focused on nuanced areas of engagement (i.e., job engagement and organizational engagement) have been offered; however, no measure of employee engagement has been advanced despite persistent calls in the research. We present the development, method, and results of a three-dimensional employee engagement measurement tool developed for use in the human resource and management fields of study. Across four independent studies, the employee engagement scale (EES) was found to consist of three subfactors (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral) and a higher-order factor (employee engagement). Across a series of four studies, we explored the factor structure and reliability of the EES (Study 1), then refined the scale, confirmed the factor structure, and examined reliability and both convergent and nomological validity evidence (Study 2). Next (Study 3), we completed a final reduction in scale items and examined additional evidence of reliability and nomological validity as well as evidence of discriminant validity. Finally (Study 4), we tested for evidence of incremental validity. In the implications for theory and practice section, we discuss the importance of an employee engagement measure aligned alongside an agreed-upon definition and framework. Limitations and future directions for research—such as the need for further psychometric testing and exploring issues of measurement invariance—are discussed. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","employee engagement; human resource; human resource development; human resource management; scale development","construct validity; discriminant validity; employee; human; human experiment; reliability; resource management",,,,,,,,"Adelson, J.L., Examining relationships and effects in gifted research: An introduction to structural equation modeling (2012) Gifted Child Quarterly, 56, pp. 47-55; Agarwal, U.A., Datta, S., Blake-Beard, S., Bhargava, S., Linking LMX, innovative work behaviour and turnover intentions: The mediating role of work engagement (2012) Career Development International, 17, pp. 208-230; Albrecht, S.L., (2010) Handbook of employee engagement: Perspectives, issues, research and practice, , Cheltenham, England, Edward Elgar; Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., Toward a model of work engagement (2008) Career Development International, 13, pp. 209-223. , 1108/130; Bhatnagar, J., Management of innovation: Role of psychological empowerment, work engagement and turnover intention in the Indian context (2012) International Journal of Human Resource Management, 23, pp. 928-951; Blais, M.A., Lenderking, W.R., Baer, L., de Lorell, A., Peets, K., Leahy, L., Burns, C., Development and initial validation of a brief mental health outcome measure (1999) Journal of Personality Assessment, 73, pp. 359-373; Brief, A.K., Weiss, H.M., Organizational behavior: Affect and the workplace (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 279-307; Brown, S.P., Leigh, T.W., A new look at psychological climate and its relationship to job involvement, effort, and performance (1996) Journal of Applied Psychology, 81, pp. 358-368; Brunetto, Y., Teo, S.T., Shacklock, K., Farr-Wharton, R., Emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, well-being and engagement: Explaining organisational commitment and turnover intentions in policing (2012) Human Resource Management Journal, 22, pp. 428-441; Christian, M.S., Garza, A.S., Slaughter, J.E., Work engagement: A quantitative review and test of its relations with task and contextual performance (2011) Personnel Psychology, 64, pp. 89-136; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development (1995) Psychological Assessment, 7, pp. 309-319; Colarelli, S.M., Methods of communication and mediating processes in realistic job previews (1984) Journal of Applied Psychology, 69, pp. 633-642; Cole, M.S., Walter, F., Bedeian, A.G., O'Boyle, E.H., Job burnout and employee engagement: A meta-analytic examination of construct proliferation (2011) Journal of Management, 38, pp. 1550-1581; Cooper-Thomas, H.D., Leighton, N., Xu, J., Knight-Turvey, N., Measuring change: Does engagement flourish, fade, or stay true?

The model takes the form of a zero-sum repeated game where each sub-game corresponds to a possible state of the attacker. Our formulation views state as the set of compromised edges in a graph opposed to the more traditional node-based view. This provides a more expressive model since it allows the defender to anticipate the direction of attack. Both players move independently and in continuous time allowing for the possibility of one player moving several times before the other does. This model shows that defense-in-depth is not always a rational strategy for budget constrained network administrators. Furthermore, a defender can dissuade a rational attacker from attempting to attack a network if the defense budget is sufficiently high. This means that a network administrator does not need to make their system completely free of vulnerabilities, they only to ensure the penalties for being caught outweigh the potential rewards gained. © 2017 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber attack modeling; Game theory; Network security; Zero-Sum games","Budget control; Computer crime; Continuous time systems; Game theory; Advanced persistent threats; Cyber attack modeling; Cyber attackers; Defense in depth; Game theoretical analysis; Network administrator; Potential rewards; Zero-sum game; Network security",,,,,,,,"(2014) Target Provides Update on Data Breach and Financial Performance, , https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2014/01/target-providesupdate-on-data-breach-and-financia, January, accessed: 2017-01-27; Falliere, N., Murchu, L.O., Chien, E., W32.

Security of the data is quite essential since its effluence may incorporate a big loss. As technology increases to preserve and secure big data, hackers and intruders express themselves one step farther. A remarkable census can be observed that every year they are exploiting the data up to a huge extent leaving companies in the loss of billions nevertheless companies are spending immense amounts to secure their data.

Modeling APT attack process can facilitate APT analysis, detection, and prediction. However, current techniques focus on modeling known attacks, which neither reflect APT attack dynamically nor take human factors into considerations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose a Targeted Complex Attack Network (TCAN) model for APT attack process based on dynamic attack graph and network evolution. Compared with current models, our model addresses human factors by conducting a two-layer network structure. Meanwhile, we present a stochastic model based on states change in the target network to specify nodes involved in the procedure of this APT. Besides, our model adopts time domain to expand the traditional attack graph into dynamic attack network. Our model is featured by flexibility, which is proven through changing the related parameters. In addition, we propose dynamic evolution rules based on complex network theory and characteristics of the actual attack scenarios. Finally, we elaborate a procedure to add nodes by a matrix operation. The simulation results show that our model can model the process of attack effectively.

These inequities have proven to be persistent and difficult to alter. Part of the reason for the frustration with slow progress is a lack of appreciation of the long-term nature of the undertaking. It is highly likely that the disparities observed in adulthood find their origins in young adulthood, if not earlier. A long-term perspective is needed, recognizing that successes may take many years to realize. This commentary presents the experience of the Center for Health And Risk in Minority youth and young adults project, which is a comprehensive center of excellence funded by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities for addressing disparities and chronic disease prevention in minority youth and young adults. The use of logic models is advanced for this kind of research because they can provide a theory of change and illustrate the course of knowledge translation over time. Logic models for cancer disparities research can place individual project activities in a realistic context that at one time indicates what is possible and reasonable to expect during the duration of a typical research project as well as the future steps that need to be taken on the way to an expected ultimate impact on cancer inequities. © 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine",,"adult; Article; asthma; behavior change; cancer incidence; cancer prevention; environmental exposure; genetic susceptibility; health disparity; human; minority group; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; risk reduction; smoking reduction; social determinants of health; tobacco use; vulnerable population; young adult; adolescent; child; ethnic group; female; male; medical research; neoplasm; practice guideline; prevention and control; procedures; program evaluation; risk factor; social support; socioeconomics; standards; statistics and numerical data; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Biomedical Research; Child; Ethnic Groups; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Minority Groups; Neoplasms; Program Evaluation; Risk Factors; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Tobacco Use; United States; Young Adult",,,,,"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS: 200-2017-M-94637

One class of cyber-attack is advanced persistent threats where highly skilled attackers can steal user authentication information's and then move laterally in the network, from host to host in a hidden manner, until they reach an attractive target. Once the presence of the attacker has been detected in the network, appropriate actions should be taken quickly to prevent the attacker going deeper. This paper presents a game theoretic approach to optimize the defense against an invader attempting to use a set of known vulnerabilities to reach critical nodes in the network. First, the network is modeled as a vulnerability multi-graph where the nodes represent physical hosts and edges the vulnerabilities that the attacker can exploit to move laterally from one host to another. Secondly, a two-player zero-sum Markov game is built where the states of the game represent the nodes of the vulnerability multi-graph graph and transitions correspond to the edge vulnerabilities that the attacker can exploit. The solution of the game gives the optimal strategy to disconnect vulnerable services and thus slow down the attack. © 2017 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threat; graph theory; Markov game; Power grid security","Authentication; Computation theory; Computer crime; Crime; Distributed computer systems; Electric power transmission networks; Game theory; Graph theory; Network security; Advanced persistent threat; Game-theoretic; Information and Communication Technologies; Markov games; Optimal strategies; Power grid securities; Power grid system; User authentication; Electric power system security",,,,,,,,"Bilis, E.I., Kröger, W., Nan, C., Performance of Electric Power Systems under Physical Malicious Attacks (2013) IEEE Systems Journal, 7 (4). , Dec; Albert, R., Albert, I., Nakarado, G.L., Structural vulnerability of thenorth American power grid (2004) Phys.

Security experts can no longer rely only on known defenses and thereby protect their resources permanently. It is increasingly common now to observe attackers being able to repeatedly break systems exploiting new vulnerabilities and defenders hardening systems with new measures. To model this phenomenon of the repeated takeover of the computing resources by system administrators and malicious attackers, a novel game framework, FlipIt, has been proposed by (Van Dijk et al. 2013) for a system consisting of a single resource. In this paper, we extend this and develop FlipNet, which is a repeated game framework for a networked system of multiple resources. This game involves two players-a defender and an attacker. Each player's objective is to maximize its gain (i.e., its control over the nodes in the network with stealthy moves), while minimizing the cost for making those moves. This leads to a novel and natural game formulation, with a very complex strategy space, that depends on the network structure. We show that finding the best response strategy for both the defender and attacker is NP-hard. In a key result in this study, we show that the attacker's gain for an instance of the game has a type of diminishing marginal return property, which leads to a near-optimal algorithm for maximizingthe attacker's gain. We examine the impact of network structure on the strategy space using simulations. © 2017 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threats; FlipIt; Security games; Zero-day attacks","Computer games; Game theory; Advanced persistent threats; FlipIt; Multiple resources; Near-optimal algorithms; Networked resources; Security games; System administrators; Zero day attack; Distributed computer systems",,,,,,,,"Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., Flipit: The game of stealthy takeover (2013) Journal of Cryptology, 26 (4), pp. 655-713; Falliere, N., Murchu, L.O., Chien, E., (2011) W32.

Yet it is striking that IRGDs are correlated with income levels, and are generally negative in emerging and developing economies, which contradicts standard economic theory. Negative IRGDs constitute a powerful debt-stabilising force, driving down debt ratios or keeping them stable even in the presence of persistent primary deficits. Motivated by the puzzling facts, this paper examines the IRGDs for a large panel of advanced and non-advanced economies by utilising a newly assembled data set. The evidence shows that large negative IRGDs in emerging and developing economies are largely due to real interest rates well below market equilibrium – stemming from financial repression and captive and distorted markets – whereas the income catch-up process plays a relatively modest role. Therefore, the IRGD in non-advanced economies is likely to rise with financial market development and financial global integration, perhaps even before their GDP per capita converges to advanced-economy levels. © 2016 Institute for Fiscal Studies.","Debt dynamics; Financial integration; Financial repression; Income catch-up; Interest-rate–growth differential; Real effective interest rates",,,,,,"International Myeloma Foundation, IMF","The views expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), its Executive Board or IMF management.

By examining Robinson’s preparatory and darkroom procedures, as well as the photographer’s extensive writing about his photographic practice, I suggest that composite photographs invited viewers to pay attention to process, and to take it into account in their evaluation of an image. This attitude challenged key tenets of academic art theory–the paradigm for nascent concepts of art in photography–by refusing to subordinate manual labour to that of the mind. While many nineteenth-century critics rejected Robinson’s approach, the debates engendered by composite techniques reveal a persistent fascination with making that advanced photographic practice as a marker of artistic value. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Alfred H.

However, the underlying mechanism for the structure-activity relationship (SAR, i.e., the chemical structures and the CL generation) remains unclear. In this study, we found that, for all 19 chlorophenol congeners tested, the CL increased with an increasing number of chlorine atoms in general; and for chlorophenol isomers (such as the 6 trichlorophenols), the CL decreased in the order of meta- > ortho-/para-Cl-substituents with respect to the -OH group of chlorophenols. Further studies showed that not only chlorinated quinoid intermediates but also, more interestingly, chlorinated semiquinone radicals were produced during the degradation of trichlorophenols by the Fenton reagent; and the type and yield of which were determined by the directing effects, hydrogen bonding, and steric hindrance effect of the OH- and/or Cl-substitution groups. More importantly, a good correlation was observed between the formation of these quinoid intermediates and CL generation, which could fully explain the above SAR findings. This represents the first report on the structure-activity relationship study and the critical role of quinoid and semiquinone radical intermediates, which may have broad chemical and environmental implications for future studies on remediation of other halogenated persistent organic pollutants by advanced oxidation processes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical bonds; Chemiluminescence; Hydrogen bonds; Isomers; Oxidation resistance; Phenols; Pollution; Reaction intermediates; Structures (built objects); Advanced Oxidation Processes; Chlorophenol isomers; Environmental implications; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Semiquinone radicals; Steric hindrance effects; Structure activity relationships; Substitution groups; Organic pollutants; 1,4 benzoquinone; chlorine; chloro 4 benzoquinone; chlorophenol; dichloro 4 benzoquinone; ferrous gluconate; hydrogen; phenol derivative; quinoid derivative; semiquinone; tetrachloro 4 benzoquinone; unclassified drug; phenol derivative; chemical compound; chlorophenol; degradation; hydrogen; oxidation; persistent organic pollutant; radical; synthetic aperture radar; Article; chemical structure; chemoluminescence; chlorination; degradation; density functional theory; electron spin resonance; hydrogen bond; kinetics; oxidation; persistent organic pollutant; stereospecificity; structure activity relation; chemistry; luminescence; oxidation reduction reaction; structure activity relation; Chlorophenols; Luminescence; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenols; Structure-Activity Relationship",,"1,4 benzoquinone, 106-51-4; chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; chlorophenol, 25167-80-0; ferrous gluconate, 299-29-6; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; semiquinone, 60766-01-0; Chlorophenols; Phenols",,,"XDB01020300

In this paper, prospect theory (PT) is applied to formulate the interaction between the defender of a cloud storage system and an APT attacker who makes subjective decisions that sometimes deviate from the results of expected utility theory, which is a basis of traditional game theory. In the PT-based cloud storage defense game with pure strategy, the defender chooses a scan interval for each storage device and the subjective APT attacker chooses his or her interval of attack against each device. A mixed-strategy subjective storage defense game is also investigated, in which each subjective defender and APT attacker acts under uncertainty about the action of its opponent. The Nash equilibria (NEs) of both games are derived, showing that the subjective view of an APT attacker can improve the utility of the defender. A Q-learning-based APT defense scheme that the storage defender can apply without being aware of the APT attack model or the subjectivity model of the attacker in the dynamic APT defense game is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed defense scheme suppresses the attack motivation of subjective APT attackers and improves the utility of the defender, compared with the benchmark greedy defense strategy. © 2017 IEEE.","advanced persistent threats; Cloud storage; game theory; prospect theory; Q-learning","Network security; Virtual storage; advanced persistent threats; Cloud storage systems; Cloud storages; Defense strategy; Expected utility theory; Nash equilibria; Prospect theory; Q-learning; Game theory",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1435778, 1549881",,,"Sagi, R.B., (2014) The Economic Impact of Advanced Persistent Threats IBM Research Intelligence, , http://www-01.ibm.com, May [Online].

In interrogating the specific driving force that keeps the irrational system of the treadmill so powerfully in place, the theory of the treadmill of production focuses on how those who control the production process, corporations, are the primary agents driving the treadmill, while also highlighting how the state and workers generally continue to provide support for the treadmill's continued reproduction. In thinking about ways to begin to unwind the treadmill, there is a clear need to explore why workers, who are also consumers and citizens, continue to support (reluctantly or not) the treadmill of production. Through an analysis of the positional economy of consumption, this paper identifies key stakes that individual consumers have in expanding their income and consumption levels through the treadmill of production, despite the widespread inefficacy of the treadmill to increase aggregate satisfaction levels. This theory of the positional economy of consumption identifies the structural forces that lock individuals into increasing their income and levels of “defensive consumption” merely to maintain their existing levels of social practices and the well-being generated from them, thus further supporting the reproduction of the treadmill of production. La théorie de l'‘engrenage de la production’ (‘treadmill of production’) démontre en quoi la recherche constante de croissance économique enferme les économies avancées dans un ‘engrenage’, où leur bien-être n'est pas amélioré par la croissance économique, mais où les impacts de la poursuite de la croissance se traduisent par des dommages environnementaux massifs et irréparables. En analysant les forces spécifiques qui préservent ce système avec autant de pouvoir, cette théorie insiste sur l'importance de ceux qui contrôlent le processus de production (les corporations) en tant que principaux agents appuyant cet ‘engrenage’, tout en soulignant comment, d'une manière générale, l'Etat et les travailleurs persistent à soutenir sa perpétuation. En pensant aux manières d'arrêter cet ‘engranage’, il y a un besoin évident d'étudier pourquoi les travailleurs, qui sont aussi consommateurs et citoyens, persistent à soutenir (à contrecœur ou pas) cet ‘engrenage’ de la production. Grâce à une analyse de l'économie positionnelle de la consommation, cet article identifie les principaux intérêts qu'ont les consommateurs individuels à augmenter leurs revenus et leurs niveaux de consommation au sein de cet engrenage de la production, en dépit de son inefficacité générale à améliorer les niveaux de satisfactions agrégés. Cette théorie de l'économie positionnelle de la consommation identifie les forces structurelles qui enferment les individus dans une recherche d'augmentation de leurs revenus et de leurs niveaux de ‘consommation défensive’, seulement pour maintenir leurs niveaux actuels de pratiques sociales et le bien-être qui en découle, contribuant ainsi à reproduire l'engrenage de la production. © 2017 Canadian Sociological Association/La Société canadienne de sociologie",,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., Horkheimer, M., (1979) Dialectic of Enlightenment, , [1944], London, Verso; Aglietta, M., (2000) A Theory of Capitalist Regulation: The US Experience, , [1976], New ed, London, Verso; Bauman, Z., (2007) Consuming Life, , Malden, MA, Polity; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, , London, Sage; Beck, U., Why ‘Class’ is too Soft a Category to Capture the Explosiveness of Social Inequality at the Beginning of the 21st Century (2013) British Journal of Sociology, 64 (1), pp. 63-74; Beck, U., Giddens, A., Lash, S., (1994) Reflexive Modernization: Politics, Tradition and Aesthetics in the Modern Social Order, , Cambridge, Polity; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Brighouse, H., Swift, A., Equality, Priority, and Positional Goods (2006) Ethics, 116 (3), pp. 471-497; Buttel, F., The Treadmill of Production: An Appreciation, Assessment, and Agenda for Research (2004) Organization & Environment, 17 (3), pp. 323-336; Campbell, C., Sociology of Consumption (1995) Acknowledging Consumption: A Review of New Studies, pp. 96-126. , in, edited by, D.

It remains unclear if meanings ascribed by patients to ABC differentiate these distress trajectories. Study aims: This qualitative study (a) compared illness meanings of ABC between women with persistent psychological distress and those with low/transient distress, and (b) examined how illness meanings might influence coping strategies. Methods: The sample was drawn from a prior quantitative study exploring psychological distress trajectories following ABC diagnosis. Overall, 42 Cantonese- or Mandarin-speaking Chinese women diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic ABC were recruited based on their distress trajectory status (low-stable, transient, or persistent distress). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed following grounded theory approach using simultaneous analysis. Results: Women with persistent distress viewed their diagnosis as another blow in life, the illness was global, permeating every aspect of their life. Maladaptive rumination and thought suppression were common responses to illness demands. These women had poor social support. A sense of demoralization stood out in their narratives. In contrast, women with transient/low-stable distress encapsulated the illness, with minimum impacts of their life. They did not evidence dysfunctional repetitive thoughts. Living in a supportive environment, they were able to accept and/or live in the present-moment. Conclusions: Rumination, thought suppression, social constraints, and pre-existing exposure to life stress may be potential risks for chronic distress in response to advanced breast cancer. Persistent and transient distress responses to cancer may have different underpinnings. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This article analyzes the complexities in evaluating the tangled relations between migrant rights activism and migration policy-making by drawing on insights from social movement theories and particularly the concepts of cognitive resonance and political opportunities. The case of Mexico’s civil society advocacy for the rights of Central American migrants and its impact on legal and administrative reforms provides an illustration of such a complex relationship. While admitting that civil society organizations contributed to certain migration reforms in Mexico, we suggest additional explanations for the Mexican state’s seeming openness to the demands advanced by pro-migrant civil society organizations. Furthermore, we argue that the Mexican state’s recent intensification of migration control, despite civil societies’ persistent criticisms, illustrates that, in fact, civil society organizations do not have much sway in shaping migration policies in this country. © 2017, © 2017 CALACS.","activism; Central America; human rights; Mexico; migration; policy; social movements","advocacy; civil society; human rights; migration; policy making; social movement; war; Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Mexico [North America]",,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: 435-2012-0308

The chapter starts with an introduction to history and theory of Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) and its application to manipulator control. Least Square Minimization (LSM) regression is highlighted as the machine learning element in indirect MRAC that seeks to fi nd unknown parameters from a number of data points. The limitations of indirect and direct MRAC are identifi ed. Specifi cally, indirect MRAC is limited by the need for persistent excitation and the use of simple modeling assumptions that lead to undesirable control performance. Direct MRAC is limited by reference model mismatch, adaptation rate, choice of control law, and relying on error feedback correction with the frequent consequence of stability and adaptation problems. Moreover, neither direct nor indirect MRAC can handle state and input constraints which are important in the control of robotic manipulators. Machine learning techniques offer the promise of overcoming these limitations. Recent developments include Concurrent-MRAC which is able to alleviate the persistent excitation requirement for LTI systems and may have application to the control of robotic manipulators. The chapter covers the broader contributions of machine learning to recent developments in manipulator control that combine learning and adaptation. This includes: (i) the use of advanced modeling methods such as Mixture Models and Neural Networks and (ii) learning control methods such as Iterative Learning Control and modern Reinforcement Learning and their relation to adaptive control. State and input constraints are identifi ed to be one of the signifi cant remaining challenges in manipulator control. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is introduced as the control method that can handle state and input constraints in its formulation. A number of recent attempts to incorporate learning capabilities in MPC are discussed. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Learning control; Machine learning; Model predictive control; Neural networks","Artificial intelligence; Concurrency control; Control theory; Flexible manipulators; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linear control systems; Linear systems; Model predictive control; Neural networks; Predictive control systems; Reinforcement learning; Robot applications; Robotics; Iterative learning control; Learning and adaptation; Learning capabilities; Learning control; Least square minimization; Machine learning techniques; Persistent excitation; State and input constraints; Model reference adaptive control",,,,,,,,"Ahn, H.-S., Chen, Y.Q., Moore, K.L., Iterative learning control: Brief survey and categorization (2007) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on, 37 (6), pp. 1099-1121; Andersson, O., Heintz, F., Doherty, P., Model-based reinforcement learning in continuous environments using real-time constrained optimization (2015) AAAI Conference on Artifi cial Intelligence; Arimoto, S., Kawamura, S., Miyazaki, F., Bettering operation of robots by learning (1984) Journal of Robotic Systems, 1 (2), pp. 123-140; Arimoto, S., Kawamura, S., Miyazaki, F., Convergence, stability and robustness of learning control schemes for robot manipulators (1986) Proceedings of the International Symposium on Robot Manipulators on Recent Trends in Robotics: Modelling, Control and Education, pp. 307-316; Astrom, K.J., Wittenmark, B., (2013) Adaptive Control: Second Edition, Dover Publications, Inc; Aswani, A., Gonzalez, H., Sastry, S.S., Tomlin, C., Provably safe and robust learning-based model predictive control (2013) Automatica, 49 (5), pp. 1216-1226; Boyd, S.P., Vandenberghe, L., (2004), Convex Optimization, Cambridge University Press; Bristow, D.A., Tharayil, M., Alleyne, A.G., A survey of iterative learning control (2006) Control Systems, IEEE, 26 (3), pp. 96-114; Chen, Y., Wen, C., (1999) Iterative learning control: Convergence, robustness and applications; Chowdhary, G., Yucelen, T., Muhlegg, M., Johnson, E.N., Concurrent learning adaptive control of linear systems with exponentially convergent bounds (2013) International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing, 27 (4), pp. 280-301; Ciliz, K., Cezayirli, A., Combined direct and indirect adaptive control of robot manipulators using multiple models (2004) Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics, 2004 IEEE Conference on, 1, pp. 525-529; Craig, J.J., Hsu, P., Sastry, S.S., Adaptive control of mechanical manipulators (1987) The International Journal of Robotics Research, 6 (2), pp. 16-28; Crespo, L.G., Matsutani, M., Annaswamy, A.M., (2010) Design of a model reference adaptive controller for an unmanned air vehicle, , American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Dubowsky, S., Deforges, D.T., The application of model reference adaptive control to robotic manipulators (1979) International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing, 101 (3), pp. 193-200; Ham, W., Adaptive control based on explicit model of robot manipulator (1993) Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on, 38 (4), pp. 654-658; He, P., Rolla, M., Jagannathan, S., Reinforcement learning neural-network-based controller for nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints (2007) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 37 (2), pp. 425-436; Hsia, T.C., (1984) Adaptive control of robot manipulators-A review.

Engineering, School of Engineering, Trinity College, Dublin College Green, Dublin 2, Ireland","Freezing phenomena in porous media have attracted great attention in geotechnics, construction engineering and geothermal energy. For shallow geothermal applications where heat pumps are connected to borehole heat exchangers (BHEs), soil freezing around the BHEs is a potential problem due to persistent heat extraction or inappropriate design which can significantly influence the temperature distribution as well as groundwater flow patterns in the subsurface, and even lead to frost heave. A fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical freezing model is required for advanced system design and scenario analyses. In the framework of the Theory of Porous Media, a triphasic freezing model is derived and solved with the finite element method. Ice formation in the porous medium results from a coupled heat and mass transfer problem with phase change and is accompanied by volume expansion. The model is able to capture various coupled physical phenomena during freezing, e.g., the latent heat effect, groundwater flow with porosity change and mechanical deformation. The current paper is focused primarily on the theoretical derivation of the conceptual model. Its numerical implementation is verified against analytical solutions of selected phenomena including pure phase change and thermo-hydro-mechanical process couplings. © 2017 International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering.

In this paper, a simulation on watering hole attack and spear phishing; comparison between these two APT variants, as well as the survey design based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) are presented. The result of the survey is analyzed using PLS-SEM. The result demonstrated that severity factor and vulnerability factor moderately explained the Protection Behaviour factor; and Protection Behaviour factor is a moderately strong predictor to self-efficacy, but avoidance behavior does not predict self-efficacy directly. Based on this result, a set of security policy for hindering watering hole and spear phishing attack is designed and implemented.

Design/methodology/approach – The research design was conducted through a survey, and the testing form was carried out using “Relationship Causal Studies” or a study to analyze the causality among environmental uncertainties, strategic orientation, innovations and performance of branches/stations of airlines in the Indonesian aviation industry. The sample was selected by determining the number of branches/ stations of the Indonesian airlines to be selected into the sample, then more than one unit managers were selected as respondents representing their respective branches/stations. The number of the target sample in this study was 250 branches. Techniques used to address the hypotheses of the present study were Descriptive Analysis and Structural Model Analysis. The inferential statistical analysis focuses on the subject of the analysis and data interpretation to draw conclusions. Findings – These research findings provide a contextual overview of the aviation industry in Indonesia that activities to make innovations in airline branches play a vital role in encouraging business performance. Moreover, the analysis shows that the more innovative a branch the better its business performance. This corroborates the finding (Spacapan and Bastic, 2007; Talke, 2007) that being highly innovative can ensure sustainable and long-term business performance. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this research suggest that innovations mediate the effect of environmental uncertainties on business performance. These findings corroborate the results of previous studies that suitability between strategic orientation and innovations of a company in response to environmental uncertainties will affect performance of the company (Li and Gima, 2001; Manu, 1992). These findings also strengthen the view that companies with a higher level of innovations (innovative) have better business performance and competitive advantages (Kessler and Chakrabarty, 1996; Salavou et al., 2004; Spacapan and Bastic, 2007). Furthermore, based on findings, it can be interpreted that management that is able to overcome barriers to innovations, maximize innovation resources and achieve the target of innovations in the form of creation of better products/services will have better performance. The ability of the management to identify and overcome barriers to innovations and maximize the sources of innovation will generate products or services that can be accepted by the customers and eventually these products and services will be able to compete with better business performance (Blumentritt and Danis, 2006). Practical implications – Findings of this research indicate the positive and significant mediating effect between environmental uncertainties on business performance, through the mediation of innovations, competitive conditions of the industrial environment which can encourage organizations to evolutionarily be more innovative in managing business to compete in the long term (Franke, 2007). This is also consistent withthe theory of evolutionary economics (Nelson and Winter, 2000) that the old strategy may not suit the changes in the environment, and therefore companies should continue to seek new breakthroughs with persistent improvement and innovations. Social implications – Dynamic and competitive conditions of the industrial environment require organizations to more intensively explore sources (capabilities) of innovations and accelerate generation of the innovations (Franke, 2007; Berry et al., 2006; Dobni, 2006; Davila et al., 2006; Spacapan and Bastic, 2007). Contextually, it appears that the competitive conditions of the aviation industry in either the short term or in the long termrequire business actors to be more innovative and to survive (Franke, 2007). Originality/value – Innovations in business models as a new effort in improvisation specific to the business stage of the basic model (not very valuable) become more advanced business processes to produce products that are more valuable for consumers, at a more efficient cost with better profitability (Chesbrough, 2007b). So far, research on the role of innovations in response to environmental uncertainties and implementation of strategies to improve the performance of the environment-strategy-performance (ESP) model is still done partially so that there is no comprehensive model to describe the role of innovations in this ESP model, or let us say that a gap between theories and opportunities to do further research on the role of innovations in the ESP model exists. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Environmental uncertainties; Innovations",,,,,,,,,"(2008), Turbulence in Booming Indonesia: Indonesia’s Third Largest Carrier Has Shut down but He Country’s Domestic Market Remains Healthy and Promising, EditionMay; Barnett, W.P., Burgelman, R.A., Evolutionary perspectives on strategy (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17, pp. 5-19. , April-June; Berry, L.L., Shankar, V., Parish, J.T., Cadwallader, S., Dotzel, T., Creating new markets through service innovation (2006) MIT Sloan Management Review, 47 (2), pp. 48-55; Bharadwaj, S.G., Varadarajan, P.R., Fahy, J., Sustainable competitive advantage in service industries: A conceptual model and research propositions (1993) Journal of Marketing, 57 (4), pp. 83-99; Blumentritt, T., Danis, W.M., Business strategy types and innovative practices (2006) Journal of Managerial Issues, 18 (2), pp. 274-291; Boyd, B.K., Sydney, F., Steve, G., How advanced is the strategy paradigm?

Particularly, we design sensor outputs cautiously against advanced persistent threats that can intervene in cyber-physical systems. Such threats are designed for the very specific target systems and seeking to achieve their malicious goals in the long term while avoiding intrusion detection. Since such attacks can avoid detection mechanisms, the controller of the system could have already been intervened in by an adversary. Disregarding such a possibility and disclosing information without caution can have severe consequences. Therefore, through secure sensor design, we seek to minimize the damage of such undetected attacks in cyber-physical systems while impacting the ordinary operations of the system at minimum. We, specifically, consider a controlled Markov-Gaussian process, where a sensor observes the state of the system and discloses information to a controller that can have friendly or adversarial intentions. We show that sensor outputs that are memoryless and linear in the state of the system can be optimal, in the sense of game-theoretic hierarchical equilibrium, within the general class of strategies. We also provide a semi-definite programming based algorithm to design the secure sensor outputs numerically. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Advanced persistent threats; Cyber-physical systems; Security; Semi-definite programming; Sensor design; Stackelberg games; Stochastic control","Control theory; Controllers; Cyber Physical System; Decision theory; Embedded systems; Intrusion detection; Stochastic systems; Advanced persistent threats; Security; Semi-definite programming; Sensor designs; Stackelberg Games; Stochastic control; Game theory",,,,,"Office of Naval Research: N00014-16-1-2710

In this context, graph theory can be applied to model the interaction among nodes and the complex attacks affecting them, as well as to design recovery techniques that ensure the survivability of the network. Accordingly, we leverage a decision model to study how a set of hierarchically selected nodes can collaborate to detect an APT within the network, concerning the presence of changes in its topology. Moreover, we implement a response service based on redundant links that dynamically uses a secret sharing scheme and applies a flexible routing protocol depending on the severity of the attack. The ultimate goal is twofold: ensuring the reachability between nodes despite the changes and preventing the path followed by messages from being discovered. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Advanced; Attack; Consensus; Detection; Dynamics; Opinion; Persistent; Redundant; Response; Secret; Sharing; Threat; Topology","Automation; Complex networks; Dynamics; Error detection; Graph theory; Security of data; Security systems; Advanced; Attack; Consensus; Opinion; Persistent; Redundant; Response; Secret; Sharing; Threat; Topology",,,,,"P11-TIC-07223

The evolution of IT (cyber) systems that control and supervise the underlying physical system has grown over decades, whereas security has not become a concern until quite recently. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have proven to be a difficult but significant challenge for practitioners. This paper adopts a game-theoretic modeling of APTs and applies it to the (sub) problem of physical intrusion in an infrastructure. The gap between defining a good theoretical model and practically instantiating it is considered in particular. The model description serves to illustrate what is needed to put it into practice. The main contribution of this paper is the demonstration of how simulation, physical understanding of an infrastructure, and theoretical methods can be combined toward a practical solution to the physical intrusion avoidance problem. Numerical results are given to show how the physical intrusion game is being set up, and how the results obtained from its analysis can be interpreted and used for an optimized defense. © 2017 IEEE.","intrusion detection; risk analysis; Security; surveillance","Game theory; Mercury (metal); Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Space surveillance; Game-theoretic model; Model description; Numerical results; Physical systems; Practical solutions; Security; Theoretical methods; Theoretical modeling; Intrusion detection",,,,,"Sixth Framework Programme: FP7-SEC-2013-1

With the increase in Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), the Internet of Things (IOT) and Advanced Persistent Threats (ATPs), network boundaries have become porous and difficult to defend from external threats. Modern malware is complex and adept at making its presence hard to detect. Recent studies have shown that some malware variants are capable of using multiple covert communication channels for command and control (C2) and data exfiltration activities. Examples of this level of covert communication can be found in malware that targets Point of Sale (POS) systems and it has been hugely successful in exfiltrating large amounts of valuable payment information that can be sold on the black market. In the vast majority of cases, malware needs to communicate with some control mechanism or human controller in order to coordinate attacks, maintain lists of compromised machines and to exfiltrate data. There are many channels that malware can use for its communication. However, in recent times there has been an increase in malware that uses the Domain Name System (DNS) for communications in some shape or form. The work carried out in this paper explores the extent to which DNS can be used as a covert communication channel by examining a number of advanced approaches that can be used to increase the stealthy nature of DNS-based covert channels. Our work describes techniques that can be used to shadow legitimate network traffic by observing network packets leaving a host machine (piggybacking), the use of statistical modelling such as the Poisson distribution and a dynamic Poisson distribution model that can be used to further conceal malicious DNS activity within a network. The results obtained from this work show that current DNS-based C2 and data exfiltration approaches employed by malware have considerable room for improvement which suggests that DNS-based covert communication will remain a realistic threat into the future.","Advanced persistent threat (APT); Botnet; Command & control (C2); Covert channels; Data exfiltration; DNS","Botnet; Command and control systems; Communication channels (information theory); Computer crime; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Poisson distribution; Advanced persistent threat (APT); Bring your own devices; Command and control (C2); Covert channels; Covert communications; Data exfiltration; Internet of thing (IOT); Statistical modelling; Malware",,,,,,,,"Atefi, K., Traffic behavior of local area network based on m/m/1 queuing model using poisson and exponential distribution (2016) 2016 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP), pp. 19-23; Born, K., Gustafson, D., Ngviz: Detecting dns tunnels through n-gram visualization and quantitative analysis (2010) Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Workshop on Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Research.

These factors range from contextual ones, such as time and available materials, to factors related to the teachers' preferred learning and teaching methodologies. In order to provide the best possible learning experience for their students and meet the objectives of a given course, teachers sometimes merge and eclectically adopt different methodologies. While this is usually suggested as the best approach to teaching any subject in theory, it raises challenges in practice. This paper aims to reflect on such challenges faced in an academic writing course designed with a blended learning approach for pre-service English language teachers. It also aims to make practical suggestions to lecturers working in tertiary education institutions in coping with such challenges. The data and results presented in this study was gathered and analyzed as part of a larger action research project, where the process genre model in the teaching of English as a foreign language writing was employed in both classroom (pen-And-paper) and online work assigned to the students as part of the advanced writing course they were enrolled in. The participants were also engaged in peer, collaborative and teacher written corrective feedback for both modes of instruction. Qualitative data was collected through a research journal, which was kept by the lecturer from the beginning to the end of the course. In addition, individual interviews with the participating students were carried out at the end of the course to elicit their perspectives on their learning experiences and challenges they may have faced during the course. The results indicated that the students' experiences in previous writing courses had a considerable impact on their attitudes towards producing multiple drafts and online work. In other words, students who were exposed to product oriented teaching and learning of writing in their early stages of language learning, had developed negative attitudes towards the process approach, which presented itself as an important challenge in encouraging students to produce multiple drafts of the same writing work. In addition, collaborative work and peer feedback also proved to be problematic with adult learners. They reported that they believed the lecturer to be the best source of knowledge, hence not trusting feedback given by their peers. The results of the study indicated, however, thatif lecturers of writing courses in tertiary education institutions are persistent and keep motivating their learners, the students,who initially resist change, later appreciate the benefits.","Academic writing; Action research; English as a foreign language; Innovative approaches; Pre-service teachers",,,,,,,,,"Arslan, R.S., Integrating feedback into prospective English language teachers' writing process via blogs and portfolios (2014) TOJET: The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, 13 (1); Arslan, R.S., Sahin-Kizil, A., How can the use of blog software facilitate the writing process of English language learners?

Evolutionary game theory is used to capture the long-term continuous behavior of the APTs on the cloud storage devices. Two APT defense games with discrete strategies are formulated, in which both an APT attacker and a defender compete to control one or multiple storage devices regarding their attack or defense intervals. The dynamical stability of each defense and attack strategy pair is studied according to the replicator dynamics criteria to characterize the locally asymptotically stable equilibrium strategies. The evolutionary stable strategy is discussed in each game, which is a subset of the asymptotically stable Nash equilibrium (NE). The phase portraits provide the locally asymptotically stable points of the APT defense game, which represent the NE showing the relationship between the asymptotic stability and evolutionary stability. © 2017 IEEE.","advanced persistent threats; cloud storage; Evolutionary game theory; replicator dynamics","Asymptotic stability; Digital storage; Network security; Stability; Stability criteria; Virtual storage; advanced persistent threats; Asymptotically stable equilibrium; Cloud storages; Evolutionary game theory; Evolutionary stability; Evolutionary stable strategies; Multiple storage devices; Replicator dynamics; Game theory",,,,,"National Science Foundation: ACI-1541069

We formulate an expert system (ES)-based APT detection game, in which an expert will double-check the suspicious behavior or potential APT attackers reported by the autonomous and inaccurate APT detection system. The Nash equilibrium of the APT detection game for IoT with ES is derived, revealing the influence of the APT detection accuracy on the utilities of the IoT system and the attacker. We propose a Q-learning based APT detection method for the IoT system with ES in the dynamic game to obtain the optimal strategy without the knowledge of the attack model. Simulation results show that the proposed APT detection scheme can efficiently use the knowledge of the expert system to improve the defender’s utility and increase the security level of the IoT device compared with the benchmark detection scheme. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Advanced persistent threats; Expert system; Game theory; Internet of Things; Reinforcement learning","Education; Expert systems; Game theory; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Advanced persistent threats; Detection accuracy; Detection methods; Detection scheme; Detection system; False alarm rate; Internet of Things (IOT); Optimal strategies; Internet of things",,,,,"2016-010

Direct photolysis rate of DTZ under EIEL irradiation was 1.34 times as that under Hg irradiation, but the electric energy consumption was 0.87 times. In this sense, the combination of EIEL and oxidants (O2, H2O2 and S2O82−(PS)) was further investigated. The remarkably increased photodegradation rates were observed in UV/PS system due to primary contribution rate of SO4[rad]− (62.5%) based on the results of radical concentrations and second-order rate constants of DTZ with SO4[rad]− and [rad]OH. Inorganic ions influencing the photodegradation process were investigated. The effect of natural organic materials (NOMs) in UV/PS system was studied based on contribution ratios of light screening effect and quenching. Transformation mechanisms of DTZ in UV/PS system included deiodination, intramolecular cyclization, decarboxylation, deacetylation and deamination, which were further confirmed by frontier electron density calculations. The study indicated that UV/PS with EIEL irradiation has the potential to remove pharmaceuticals in contaminated aquatic environments. © 2017","Diatrizoate; Electromagnetic induction electrodeless lamp; Quantum chemical calculations; Radicals; UV-based advanced oxidation","Acetylation; Carboxylation; Contrast media; Cyclization; Electrodes; Electromagnetic induction; Energy utilization; Irradiation; Photolysis; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Advanced oxidation; Diatrizoate; Electrode-less lamp; Quantum chemical calculations; Radicals; Photodegradation; diatrizoate; free radical; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxyl group; iodinated contrast medium; ion; mercury; natural organic matter; oxidizing agent; oxygen; persulfate; sulfate; sulfur derivative; unclassified drug; water; aquatic environment; chemical analysis; drug; electrical power; electrode; electron density; electronic equipment; free radical; irradiation; oxidation; photodegradation; photolysis; pollutant removal; ultraviolet radiation; aquatic environment; Article; biotransformation; calculation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cyclization; deacetylation; deamination; decarboxylation; deiodination; density functional theory; electricity; electromagnetic induction electrodeless lamp; electromagnetism; electron; electron spin resonance; energy consumption; frontier electron density calculation; light; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; magnetic and electromagnetic equipment; photodegradation; photolysis; photooxidation; ultraviolet irradiation; waste water management; water contamination; water pollutant; X ray",,"diatrizoate, 117-96-4, 737-31-5; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; oxygen, 7782-44-7; sulfate, 14808-79-8; water, 7732-18-5",,,,,,"Kovalova, L., Siegrist, H., Singer, H., Wittmer, A., McArdell, C.S., Hospital wastewater treatment by membrane bioreactor: performance and efficiency for organic micropollutant elimination (2012) Environ.

This EC/EF system exhibited much higher degradation rate, decholorination and mineralization efficiency of atrazine than the electrochemical (EC) and electrochemical/traditional electro-Fenton (EC/TEF) oxidation counterpart systems without Fe@Fe2O3core-shell nanowires. Active species trapping experiment revealed that Fe@Fe2O3could activate molecular oxygen to produce more [rad]OH through Fenton reaction, which favored the atrazine degradation. High performance liquid chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were applied to probe the decomposition and mineralization of atrazine during this novel EC/EF process, which revealed that two intermediates of triazinons (the isomerization of hydroxylated atrazine) were generated during the electrochemical/electro-Fenton oxidation of atrazine in the presence of Fe@Fe2O3core-shell nanowires. The experimental and theoretical calculation results suggested that atrazine might be degraded via a triazinon ring opening mechanism, while the presence of Fe@Fe2O3notably accelerated the decholorination process, and produced more hydroxylated products to promote the generation of trazinons and the subsequent ring cleavage as well as the final complete mineralization. This work provides a deep insight into the triazine ring opening mechanism and the design of efficient electrochemical advanced oxidation technologies (EAOTs) for persistent organic pollutant removal. © 2017","Atrazine; Boron-doped diamond; Electrochemical advanced oxidation; Fe@Fe2O3/ACF electrode; Fenton","Carbon fibers; Degradation; Electrodes; Gas chromatography; Hematite; Herbicides; High performance liquid chromatography; Hydroxylation; Mass spectrometry; Mineralogy; Molecular oxygen; Nanowires; Organic pollutants; Reaction intermediates; Advanced oxidation; Advanced oxidation technology; Boron doped diamond; Fenton; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; High performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometries; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Theoretical calculations; Oxidation; activated carbon; atrazine; hydrogen peroxide; iron; nanowire; atrazine; boron; diamond; ferric ion; iron; water pollutant; activated carbon; atrazine; boron; carbon fiber; decomposition; degradation; diamond; electrochemical method; electrode; iron; mineralization; oxidation; ozone; persistent organic pollutant; Article; dechlorination; decomposition; density functional theory; drug degradation; electrochemical analysis; electron; Fenton reaction; high performance liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass fragmentography; mineralization; priority journal; ring opening; total organic carbon; chemistry; electrode; oxidation reduction reaction; water pollutant; Atrazine; Boron; Diamond; Electrodes; Ferric Compounds; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"activated carbon, 64365-11-3, 82228-96-4; atrazine, 1912-24-9; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; boron, 7440-42-8; diamond, 7782-40-3; ferric ion, 20074-52-6; Atrazine; Boron; Diamond; Ferric Compounds; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 21407044, 21607047, 51572101

The diversity and usual stealthiness of APT turns them into a central problem of contemporary practical system security, since information on attacks, the current system status or the attacker's incentives is often vague, uncertain and in many cases even unavailable. Game theory is a natural approach to model the conflict between the attacker and the defender, and this work investigates a generalized class of matrix games as a risk mitigation tool for an advanced persistent threat (APT) defense. Unlike standard game and decision theory, our model is tailored to capture and handle the full uncertainty that is immanent to APTs, such as disagreement among qualitative expert risk assessments, unknown adversarial incentives and uncertainty about the current system state (in terms of how deeply the attacker may have penetrated into the system's protective shells already). Practically, game-theoretic APT models can be derived straightforwardly from topological vulnerability analysis, together with risk assessments as they are done in common risk management standards like the ISO 31000 family. Theoretically, these models come with different properties than classical game theoretic models, whose technical solution presented in this work may be of independent interest. © 2017 Rass et al.

As molecular structures of organic micropollutants contain multiple ozone-preferred reaction sites, and moreover intermediate products can react with ozone again, ozonation mechanism is complex. A fast increasing number of organic micropollutants and a great demand of ecological risk assessments call for an in silico method to provide insights into the ozonation mechanism of organic micropollutants. Here, an in silico model was developed to unveil ozonation mechanisms of organic micropollutants. Sulfamethoxazole was taken as a case. The model enumerates elementary reactions following well-accepted ozonation patterns and secondary transformation reactions established for intermediates by experiments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed for evaluating thermodynamic feasibilities of reaction pathways. By calculating Gibbs free energies, ozonation products of SMX were predicted. The predicted products are consistent with those detected in experiments. This method is advanced in revealing all possible reaction pathways including minor pathways that produce toxic byproducts but are difficult to be observed by experiments. Accordingly, water treatment engineers can setup necessary treatment technology to ensure water safety. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Density functional theory; Gibbs free energy; Organic micropollutant; Ozonation mechanism; Sulfamethoxazole","Byproducts; Density functional theory; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Ozone; Ozonization; Reaction intermediates; Risk assessment; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Ecological risk assessment; Organic micro-pollutants; Organic micropollutant; Secondary transformation; Sulfamethoxazole; Thermodynamic feasibility; Treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment plants; Ozone water treatment; sulfamethoxazole; ozone; sulfamethoxazole; waste water; water pollutant; drug; Gibbs free energy; organic pollutant; transformation; wastewater treatment plant; water technology; Article; controlled study; electron transport; electrophilicity; oxygen transport; ozonation; persistent organic pollutant; proton transport; thermodynamics; waste water management; water quality; analysis; chemistry; procedures; sewage; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Ozone; Sulfamethoxazole; Thermodynamics; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",,"sulfamethoxazole, 723-46-6; ozone, 10028-15-6; Ozone; Sulfamethoxazole; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"2013AA06A305

Moreover, an advanced attacker may choose to approach insiders within the organization. Insider information can not only reduce the attack cost significantly but also make the attack more covert. Although stealthy attacks and insider threats have been considered separately in previous works, the coupling of the two is not well understood. As both types of threats are incentive driven, game theory is an appropriate tool to reason about the strategic behavior for each participant. We propose a non-zero sum three-player game model to study the interplay between APT and insider threats. Our model is built upon the two-player FlipIt game model for stealthy takeover with two extensions. First, we consider an asymmetric feedback structure where the defender is observable, while the attacker is stealthy and obtains delayed feedback about the defender's security updates. Second, we consider a three-player setting by introducing an insider with a double role, where it can help either the attacker or the defender according to the payoffs. We characterize the subgame perfect equilibria of a sequential game with the defender as the leader, and the insider and the attacker as the followers. We derive various insights from the game model, and discuss approaches for achieving more efficient defense in the face of both a stealthy attacker and an insider with double roles. © 2016 IEEE.","Computer security; Couplings; Delays; Game theory; Games; Numerical models","Computer games; Couplings; Military communications; Numerical models; Security of data; Delayed feedback; Delays; Feedback structure; Game-theoretic model; Games; Insider Threat; Sequential games; Strategic Behavior; Game theory",,,,,,,,"Tankard, C., Advanced persistent threats, how to monitor, deter them (2011) Network Security, 2011 (8), pp. 16-19; Virvilis, N., Gritzalis, D., The big four-what we did wrong in advanced persistent threat detection (2013) ARES, 2013 Eighth International Conference On.IEEE, pp. 248-254; Bencsáth, B., Pék, G., Buttyán, L., Félegyházi, M., The cousins of stuxnet: Duqu, flame, gauss (2012) Future Internet, 4, pp. 971-1003; http://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-iteffectiveness/publications/us-state-of-cybercrime.jhtml, 2014 US State of Cybercrime Survey; Kandias, M., Virvilis, N., Gritzalis, D., The insider threat in cloud computing (2013) Critical Information Infrastructure Security, pp. 93-103. , Springer; Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., Flipit: The game of ""stealthy takeover (2013) Journal of Cryptology, 26 (4), pp. 655-713; Laszka, A., Johnson, B., Grossklags, J., Mitigating covert compromises: A game-theoretic model of targeted, non-targeted covert attacks (2013) Proc. of WINE; Zhang, M., Zheng, Z., Shroff, N.B., A game theoretic model for defending against stealthy attacks with limited resources (2015) Proc. of GameSec; Feng, X., Zheng, Z., Hu, P., Cansever, D., Mohapatra, P., Stealthy attacks meets insider threats: A three-player game model (2015) Proc. of IEEE MILCOM, pp. 25-30. , Oct; Feng, X., Zheng, Z., Cansever, D., Swami, A., Mohapatra, P., Stealthy attacks with insider information: A game theoretic model with asymmetric feedback Technical Report, , http://spirit.cs.ucdavis.edu/pubs/tr/mil16.pdf, available online at",,,"AFCEA;IEEE Communication Society","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","35th IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2016","1 November 2016 through 3 November 2016",,125573,,9781509037810,PMICE,,"English","Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011841671

We focused on Advanced Persistent Threat which is stealthy, targeted and data focused, progressive defense system is designed and Implemented along with mathematical analysis concerned with networks and algorithms. A self-destructive and Constructive mechanism is adopted using bilinear mapping and reverse engineering methods. Prime issues for cloud securities such as Confidentiality and Authentication are discussed. A Practical and Computational Approach is designed and implemented using cryptography concepts such as Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption and ElGamal encryption and fuzzy logic system based on Advanced Intelligence system through a mathematical transformation and finally conceptual analysis is given. © 2016 IEEE.","Advanced Persistent Threat; Cloud Security; Defense system; Reverse Engineering; Self-destructive mechanisms","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Cryptography; Fuzzy logic; Interoperability; Mathematical transformations; Network security; Reverse engineering; Advanced Persistent Threat; Cloud securities; Computational approach; Defense system; Destructive mechanism; Diffie-Hellman assumption; Software interoperability; Virtualization technologies; Distributed computer systems",,,,,,,,"Li, F., Lai, A., Ddl, D., Evidence of advanced persistent threat: A case study of malware for political espionage (2011) 6th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE) 2011, pp. 102-109. , IEEE 18-19 Oct; Vijaya Chandra, J., Challa, N., Ali Hussain, M., Data and information storage security from advanced persistent attack in cloud computing (2014) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research; Vijaya Chandra, J., Challa, N., SaiKiran, P., Thirupathi, R.K., Krishna, R.V., Numerical formulation and simulation of social networks using graph theory on social cloud platform (2015) Global Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics., 11 (2), pp. 1253-1264; Vijaya Chandra, J., Challa, N., Kiran Pasupuleti, S., Intelligence based defense system to protect from advanced persistent threat by means of social engineering on social cloud platform (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (28). , October; Yue, F., Wang, G., Liu, Q., A secure self-destructing scheme for electronic data (2010) IEEE/IFIP 8th International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC)-2010, pp. 651-658. , 11-13 Dec; Zeng, L., Chen, S., Wei, Q., Feng, D., SeDas: A self-destructing data system based on active storage framework (2013) IEEE Transactions on in Magnetics, 49 (6), pp. 2548-2554. , June; Zeng, L., Shi, Z., Xu, S., Feng, D., SafeVanish: An improved data self-destruction for protecting data privacy (2010) IEEE Second International Conference on in Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom), pp. 521-528. , IEEE Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010; Hu, P., Li, H., Fu, H., Cansever, D., Mohapatra, P., Dynamic defense strategy against advanced persistent threat with insiders (2015) IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), pp. 747-755. , April 26 2015-May 1 2015; Vukalovic, J., Delija, D., Advanced Persistent Threats-detection and defense (2015) 38th International Convention OnInformation and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO), pp. 1324-1330. , 25-29 May 2015; Geambasu, R., Kohno, T., Levy, A.A., Levy, H.M., Vanish: Increasing data privacy with self-destructing data (2009) SSYM'09 Proceedings of the 18th Conference on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 299-316. , USENIX Association Berkeley, CA, USA; Xiong, J., Yao, Z., Ma, J., Liu, X., Li, Q., A secure document self-destruction scheme: An ABE approach (2013) IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (HPCC-EUC), pp. 59-64. , 13-15 Nov; Xiong, J., Liu, X., Yao, Z., Ma, J., Li, Q., Geng, K., Chen, P.S., A secure data self-destructing scheme in cloud computing (2014) IEEE Transactions on InCloud Computing, 2 (4), pp. 448-458. , Oct.-Dec. 1; Mikhail, M., Abouelseoud, Y., Elkobrosy, G., Extension and application of El-Gamal encryption scheme (2014) 2014 World Congress on Computer Applications and Information Systems (WCCAIS), pp. 1-6. , 17-19 Jan; Wang, H., Zheng, Z., Wu, L., Hierarchial identity-based encryption scheme from multilinear maps (2014) Tenth International Conference OnComputational Intelligence and Security (CIS), pp. 455-458. , 15-16 Nov. 2014; Huang, K., Tso, R., A commutative encryption scheme based on ElGamalencryption (2012) International Conference on Information Security and Intelligence Control (ISIC), pp. 156-159. , 14-16 Aug; Adrian, D., Bhargavan, K., Durumeric, Z., Gaudry, P., Green, M., Alex Halderman, J., Heninger, N., Zimmermann, P., Imperfect forward secrecy: How diffie-hellman fails in practice (2015) Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, , October 12-16; Liu, J., Huang, K., Rong, H., Wang, H., Xian, M., Privacy-preserving public auditing for regenerating-code-based cloud storage (2015) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 10 (7), pp. 1513-1528. , July",,,"Ramani Group of Companies;Volkswagen","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd IEEE International Conference on Engineering and Technology, ICETECH 2016","17 March 2016 through 18 March 2016",,123892,,9781467399166,,,"English","Proc.

Why so? Existing theories, mostly based on various approaches tied to cognitive decision-making, do not provide a sufficient explanation of the persistence of marriage. In this article, we argue that feelings attached to marriage, i.e. the affective evaluation of those involved in a partner relationship concerning marriage as opposed to cohabitation, explain the persistent importance of marriage as an institution. We argue that socialization, biological and social-structural factors affect these affective evaluations. We provide a test of our hypotheses using a longitudinal study of young adults in the Netherlands. The results of our analyses are consistent with a central role of feelings in the decision to marry, as well as with a role for key moderating factors such as gender. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2016","affective evaluations; cohabitation; emotions; Marriage; Second Demographic Transition; transition to adulthood",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., (1988) Attitudes, Personality and Behavior, , Milton Keynes, Open University Press; Ajzen, I., The Theory of Planned Behavior' (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Amato, P., The Consequences of Divorce for Adults and Children' (2000) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 62 (40), pp. 1269-1287; Bachrach, C.A., Morgan, S.P., A Cognitive–Social Model of Fertility Intentions' (2013) Population and Development Review, 39 (3), pp. 459-485; Baizán, P., Aassve, A., Billari, F.C., The Interrelations Between Cohabitation, Marriage and First Birth in Germany and Sweden' (2004) Population and Environment, 25 (6), pp. 531-561; Basu, A.M., The Emotions and Reproductive Health' (2006) Population and Development Review, 32 (1), pp. 107-121; Becker, G.S., A Theory of Marriage: Part I', The (1973) Journal of Political Economy, 81 (4), pp. 813-846; Becker, G.S., A Theory of Marriage: Part II', The (1974) Journal of Political Economy, 82 (2), pp. S11-S26; Ben-Porath, Y., The F-Connection: Families, Friends, and Firms and the Organization of Exchange' (1980) Population and Development Review, 6 (1), pp. 1-30; Billari, F.C., Liefbroer, A.C., Should I Stay or Should I Go?

As the excellent imperceptibility as well as long-term persistence in APT attack, this paper proposes a prediction model based on dynamin Bayesian game. Focusing on the particular features in APT, a corresponding quantitative method is proposed for calculating the behavior payoff. Then, the dynamic Bayesian model is established on the basis of the attack process. The game equilibrium is calculated through the designed solution, which can be used to guide the prediction of APT attack behavior. The experimental result shows that the proposed method achieves great accuracy and effectiveness. © 2016 IEEE.","APT attack; dynamic Bayesian game model; game theory; payoff quantitative method","Bayesian networks; Cloud computing; Computation theory; Data handling; Forecasting; Game theory; Information analysis; APT attack; Attack behavior; Bayesian game; Behavior prediction; Game equilibrium; Network attack; Prediction model; Quantitative method; Big data",,,,,,,,"Tao, Z., Four Characteristics of Advanced Persistent Threat; Tao, Z., Time-against: New method against APT attack (2013) Computer and Network, (20); Chen, J., Qiang, W., Miao, W., Network APT attack and the defense strategy (2012) Information and Security Communication, p. 7; Lin, L., Bo, C., Guo, X., New threat for traditional network security denfese: APT attack (2013) Information Security, 3, pp. 20-25; Du, Y., Zhai, L., Vue, L., Jia, Z., Security architecture to deal with APT Attacks: Abnormal discovery (2014) Journal of Computer Research and Development, pp. 1633-1645; Rui, G., Deep dynamic defense rresponds to APT attack (2014) Information Security and Technology, pp. 67-69; Kim, Y.H., Park, W.H., A study on cyber threat prediction based on intursion detection event for APT attack detection (2014) Multimed Tools Application, (71), pp. 685-698; Kato, M., Matsunami, T., Kanaoka, A., Koide, H., Okamoto, E., Tracing advanced persistent threats in networked systems (2013) Automated Security Management, pp. 179-187; Wei, J., Fang, B., Tian, Z., Zhang, H., Network Security assessment and the optimal active defense based on attackdefense game model (2010) Chinese Journal of Computers, 32 (4), pp. 817-827; Wang, Y., Lin, C., Xueqi, C., Fang, B., Analysis for network Attack-Defense based on stochastic game model (2010) Chinese Journal of Computers, 33 (9), pp. 1748-1762","Haopu, Y.; Information and Engineering UniversityChina; email: mem03ang@126.com",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis, ICCCBDA 2016","5 July 2016 through 7 July 2016",,123026,,9781509025930,,,"English","Proc.

We check that our method reproduces the thermal spectral function given by the Son-Starinets prescription. The time-dependence of the spectral function of a relevant scalar operator is studied in a class of non-equilibrium states. The latter are represented by AdS-Vaidya geometries with an arbitrary parameter characterising the timescale for the dual state to transit from an initial thermal equilibrium to another due to a homogeneous quench. For long quench duration, the spectral function indeed follows the thermal form at the instantaneous effective temperature adiabatically, although with a slight initial time delay and a bit premature thermalisation. At shorter quench durations, several new non-adiabatic features appear: (i) time-dependence of the spectral function is seen much before than that in the effective temperature (advanced time-dependence), (ii) a big transfer of spectral weight to frequencies greater than the initial temperature occurs at an intermediate time (kink formation) and (iii) new peaks with decreasing amplitudes but in greater numbers appear even after the effective temperature has stabilised (persistent oscillations). We find four broad routes to thermalisation for lower values of spatial momenta. At higher values of spatial momenta, kink formations and persistent oscillations are suppressed, and thermalisation time decreases. The general thermalisation pattern is globally top-down, but a closer look reveals complexities. © 2016, The Author(s).","AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes in String Theory; Gauge-gravity correspondence",,,,,,,,,"(2006) Phys.

Exemplified by the persistent organic pollutant 2-nitrophenol in water, the fundamental model and practical system are exhibited for the STEP-AOPs to efficiently transform 2-nitrophenol into carbon dioxide, water, and the other substances. The results show that the STEP-AOPs system performs more effectively than classical AOPs in terms of the thermodynamics and kinetics of pollutant oxidation. Due to the combination of solar thermochemical reactions with electrochemistry, the STEP-AOPs system allows the requisite electrolysis voltage of 2-nitrophenol to be experimentally decreased from 1.00 V to 0.84 V, and the response current increases from 18 mA to 40 mA. STEP-AOPs also greatly improve the kinetics of the oxidation at 30 °C and 80 °C. As a result, the removal rate of 2-nitrophenol after 1 h increased from 19.50% at 30 °C to 32.70% at 80 °C at constant 1.90 V. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the oxidation pathway is favorably changed because of thermal effects. The tracking of the reaction displayed that benzenediol and hydroquinone are initial products, with maleic acid and formic acid as sequential carboxylic acid products, and carbon dioxide as the final product. The theory and experiments on STEP-AOPs system exemplified by the oxidation of 2-nitrophenol provide a broad basis for extension of the STEP and AOPs for rapid and efficient treatment of organic wastewater. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","2-Nitrophenol; Advanced oxidation processes; Solar; Solar thermal electrochemical process; Wastewater treatment","Carbon dioxide; Electrochemistry; Organic pollutants; Solar energy; Solar heating; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; 2-nitrophenol; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Electrochemical process; Electrolysis voltages; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Solar; Thermochemical reactions; Thermodynamics and kinetics; Oxidation; 2 nitrophenol; benzene derivative; benzenediol; carbon dioxide; carboxylic acid; formic acid; hydroquinone; maleic acid; unclassified drug; 2-nitrophenol; nitrophenol; waste water; water pollutant; carbon dioxide; chemical alteration; electrochemistry; organic acid; oxidation; persistent organic pollutant; phenolic compound; solar power; thermodynamics; waste treatment; wastewater; advanced oxidation processes; Article; chemical reaction; current density; cyclic potentiometry; degradation; electrochemistry; electrolysis; enthalpy; oxidation; oxygen evolution; reaction analysis; reaction time; solar energy; solar thermal electrochemical process; thermodynamics; waste water; waste water management; chemistry; isolation and purification; oxidation reduction reaction; procedures; sunlight; temperature; waste water; water pollutant; Electrochemistry; Electrolysis; Nitrophenols; Oxidation-Reduction; Solar Energy; Sunlight; Temperature; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"2 nitrophenol, 88-75-5; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; formic acid, 64-18-6, 71-47-6; hydroquinone, 123-31-9; maleic acid, 110-16-7, 18610-42-9; nitrophenol, 25154-55-6; 2-nitrophenol; Nitrophenols; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"21306022, 21376049

This paper, part of the NSF Awardees Poster Session, presents results from a RIGEE-funded project whose aim is study how formal and informal interactions with engineering agents (professionals and faculty) influence attitudes and intentions of underrepresented minority (URM) students for enrollment and persistence in engineering. The project employs a case study approach focused on two key phases of engineering education - initial enrollment and persistence to advanced program stages - guided by a framework that incorporates social cognitive, social capital, and community cultural wealth theories. We report on the findings of four studies conducted as part of this project, which guide recommendations for further research and practice. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2013 (Special Report NSF, , http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/, Arlington, VA: Author.

Daniel St., Champaign, IL  61820, United States","Path integration and cognitive mapping are two of the most important mechanisms for navigation. Path integration is a primitive navigation system which computes a homing vector based on an animal’s self-motion estimation, while cognitive map is an advanced spatial representation containing richer spatial information about the environment that is persistent and can be used to guide flexible navigation to multiple locations. Most theories of navigation conceptualize them as two distinctive, independent mechanisms, although the path integration system may provide useful information for the integration of cognitive maps. This paper demonstrates a fundamentally different scenario, where a cognitive map is constructed in three simple steps by assembling multiple path integrators and extending their basic features. The fact that a collection of path integration systems can be turned into a cognitive map suggests the possibility that cognitive maps may have evolved directly from the path integration system. © 2015, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Cognitive map; Evolution; Navigation; Path integration; Spatial updating","animal; cognition; human; spatial orientation; Animals; Cognition; Humans; Spatial Navigation",,,,,,,,"Alyan, S., McNaughton, B.L., Hippocampectomized rats are capable of homing by path integration (1999) Behavioral Neuroscience, 113, pp. 19-31. , PID: 10197903; Amorim, M.A., Glasauer, S., Corpinot, K., Berthoz, A., Updating an object’s orientation and location during non-visual navigation: A comparison between two processing modes (1997) Perception & Psychophysics, 59, pp. 404-418; Bennett, A.T.D., Do animals have cognitive maps?

Can new insight be advanced into the nature of quantum nonlocality by seeking new links between quantum and emergent phenomena as described by self-organization, complexity, or emergence theory? Could the development of a future EmQM lead to a unified, relational image of the cosmos? One key motivation for adopting the concept of emergence in relation to quantum theory concerns the persistent failure in standard physics to unify the two pillars in the foundations of physics: quantum theory and general relativity theory (GRT). The total contradiction in the foundational, metaphysical assumptions that define orthodox quantum theory versus GRT might render inter-theoretic unification impossible. On the one hand, indeterminism and non-causality define orthodox quantum mechanics, and, on the other hand, GRT is governed by causality and determinism. How could these two metaphysically-contradictory theories ever be reconciled? The present work argues that metaphysical contradiction necessarily implies physical contradiction. The contradictions are essentially responsible also for the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. A common foundation may be needed for overcoming the contradictions between the two foundational theories. The concept of emergence, and the development of an EmQM, might help advance a common foundation - physical and metaphysical - as required for successfull inter-theory unification. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Mechanics; Quantum communication; Relativity; Emergent phenomenon; General relativity theory; Measurement problems; Nonlocal; Physical contradictions; Quantum nonlocality; Self organizations; Quantum theory",,,,,,"Acknowledgments Work by Jan Walleczek at Phenoscience Laboratories (Berlin) is partially funded by the Fetzer Franklin Fund of the John E.

We present here the integration of 2, 4-dihydroxybenzophenone (UV-0) and N-methylol acrylamide (NMA) for novel ultraviolet absorber namely (3,5-dimethacrylamide-2,4-dihydroxyphenyl) (phenyl)methanone (UV-CA), which is subsequently utilized as a crosslinking agent after suffering Friedel-Crafts reaction. The preliminary results demonstrate that quantum chemical calculations (DFT) is a promising avenue in demonstrating the optimized geometry, charges, energy levels and UV electronic absorption bands of the UV-CA in the singlet (steady and excited states). The structure parameters and natural band orbital (NBO) calculations suggest that the intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB) in the UV-0 group is significantly enhanced in comparison to that between UV-0 and NMA groups. The acrylic acid polymers functionalized with UV-CA yield high crosslinking degree and robust UV absorbing performance.

Instead, this paper endorses the socio technical systems approach of including people and information within the analysis of an intrusion campaign and reclassifying this as a threat system. Actor-Network system theory is used as the analytical method to shed new insight into four case studies of apparently very different threat systems. The Stuxnet malware’s infection of the Iranian nuclear supply chain in 2010 is compared to the Sony hack of 2014 as examples of the different poles of sophistication that Computer Network Attack can manifest itself within. In contrast the Newscaster and Ouroboros case studies are used to illustrate the operational sophistication that is often overlooked by a purely technical analysis. This piece concludes with an assessment of techniques such as Actor-Network system theory and other socio technical approaches - demonstrating that they can have a critical place within the future of cyber security. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this paper, prospect theory is applied to study the interactions between a subjective cloud storage defender and a subjective APT attacker. Two subjective APT games are formulated, in which the defender chooses its interval to scan the storage device and the attacker decides its duration between launching two attacks under uncertain APT attack durations and action of the opponent, respectively. The Nash equilibria of the static subjective APT games are derived. We also study the dynamic APT game and propose a Q-learning based APT defense strategy for cloud storage. Simulation results show that the APT defense benefits from the subjective view of the attacker and the proposed defense strategy can improve detection performance with a higher utility. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Virtual storage; Cloud storages; Defense strategy; Detection performance; Nash equilibria; Prospect theory; Q-learning; Network security",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1435778",,,"Cao, N., Wang, C., Li, M., Ren, K., Lou, W., Privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data (2014) IEEE Trans.

We comprehensively overview one of the most important tools for the analysis such problems—the theory of recursive contracts. Recursive formulations allow us to reduce often complex models to a sequence of essentially static problems that are easier to analyze both analytically and computationally. We first provide a self-contained treatment of the basic theory: the Revelation Principle, formulating and simplifying the incentive constraints, using promised utilities as state variables, and analyzing models with persistent shocks using the first-order approach. We then discuss more advanced topics: duality theory and Lagrange multiplier techniques, models with lack of commitment, and martingale methods in continuous time. Finally, we show how a variety of applications in public economics, corporate finance, development and international economics featuring incomplete risk sharing can be analyzed using the tools of the theory of recursive contracts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous time contracts; Dynamic mechanism design; First-order approach; Hidden storage; Incomplete markets; Lagrangian; Limited commitment; Principal–agent model; Private information; Promised utility; Recursive contracts; Revelation Principle",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, A., Pavoni, N., Efficient allocations with moral hazard and hidden borrowing and lending: a recursive formulation (2008) Rev.

Modeling APT attack process can facilitate APT analysis and detection. However, existed modeling approaches neither reflects APT attack dynamically nor takes human factor into consideration. In order to achieve this, we propose a Targeted Complex Attack Network (TCAN) model for APT attack process. Compared with current models, our model addresses human factor by conducting two-layer network structure. Besides, our model introduces time domain to expand the traditional attack graph into dynamic attack network. Whats more, we propose dynamic evolution rules based on complex network theory and characteristics of the actual attack scenarios. Our simulation results show that the model can express the process of attack effectively. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","APT; Attack process modelling; Complex network theory; Human factor; TCAN","Circuit theory; Complex networks; Computation theory; Human engineering; Network layers; Attack scenarios; Current models; Dynamic evolution rules; Model approach; Network attack; Process modelling; TCAN; Two-layer network; Computer crime",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61402080, 61502086, 61572115

Data exfiltration over DNS queries involves unauthorized transfer of sensitive data from an organization to a remote adversary through a DNS data tunnel to a malicious web domain. Given the noisy sensors, previous work has illustrated that standard approaches fail to satisfactorily rise to the challenge of detecting exfiltration attempts. Instead, we propose a decision-theoretic technique that sequentially plans to accumulate evidence under uncertainty while taking into account the cost of deploying such sensors. More specifically, we provide a fast scalable POMDP formulation to address the challenge, where the efficiency of the formulation is based on two key contributions: (i) we use a virtually distributed POMDP (VD-POMDP) formulation, motivated by previous work in distributed POMDPs with sparse interactions, where individual policies for different sub-POMDPs are planned separately but their sparse interactions are only resolved at execution time to determine the joint actions to perform; (ii) we allow for abstraction in planning for speedups, and then use a fast MILP to implement the abstraction while resolving any interactions. This allows us to determine optimal sensing strategies, leveraging information from many noisy detectors, and subject to constraints imposed by network topology, forwarding rules and performance costs on the frequency, scope and efficiency of sensing we can perform. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Abstracting; Chemical detection; Decision theory; Efficiency; Game theory; Integer programming; Internet protocols; Virtual addresses; Data exfiltration; Decision-theoretic; Detection sensors; Domain name system; Network topology; Noisy observations; Performance costs; Sensitive datas; Network security",,,,,"Army Research Office, ARO: W911NF-15-1-0515","This research was supported by ARO Grant W911NF-15-1-0515.",,"https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/dns/detecting-dns-tunneling-34152, Accessed 14 June 2016; https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/2014/10/23942-new-frameworkpos-variant-exfiltrates-datavia-dns-requests, Accessed 14 June 2016; (2014), http://code.kryo.se/iodine/; (2015), http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-data-exfiltration.pdf, data exfiltration study: Actors, tactics, and detection; http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/cluster-of-megabreachescompromise-a-whopping-642-million-passwords/; Bernstein, D.S., Zilberstein, S., Immerman, N., The complexity of decentralized control of Markov decision processes (2000) Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 32-37. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc; Borders, K., Prakash, A., Web tap: Detecting covert web traffic (2004) Proceedings of the 11Th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 110-120. , ACM; Farnham, G., (2013) Detecting DNS Tunneling.

The model is based on a sequence of nested finite two-person zero-sum games, in which the APT is modeled as the attempt to get through multiple protective shells of a system towards conquering the target located in the center of the infrastructure. In each stage, a sub-game captures the attack and defense interactions between two players, and its outcome determines the security level and the resilience against penetrations as well as the structure of the game in the next stage. By construction, interdependencies between protections at multiple stages are automatically accounted for by the dynamic game. The game model provides an analysis and design framework to develop effective protective layers and strategic defense-indepth strategies against APTs. We discuss a few closed form solutions of our sequential APT-games, upon which design problems can be formulated to optimize the quality of security (QoS) across several layers. Numerical experiments are conducted in this work to corroborate our results. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Decision theory; Closed form solutions; Defense in depth strategy; Defense strategy; Design frameworks; Numerical experiments; Protective layers; Quality-of-Security; Two-person zero-sum game; Game theory",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

While the technical community is working on improved system designs to prevent and mitigate such attacks, a significant residual risk remains that attacks succeed and may not even be detected, i.e., they are stealthy. Our objective is to inform security policy design for the mitigation of stealthy information leakage attacks. Such a policy mechanism advises system owners on the optimal timing to reset defense mechanisms, e.g., changing cryptographic keys or passwords, reinstalling systems, installing new patches, or reassigning security staff. We follow a game-theoretic approach and propose a model titled FlipLeakage. In our proposed model, an attacker will incrementally and stealthily take ownership of a resource (e.g., similar to advanced persistent threats). While her final objective is a complete compromise of the system, she may derive some utility during the preliminary phases of the attack. The defender can take a costly recovery move and has to decide on its optimal timing. Our focus is on the scenario when the defender can only partially eliminate the foothold of the attacker in the system. Further, the defender cannot undo any information leakage that has already taken place during an attack. We derive optimal strategies for the agents in FlipLeakage and present numerical analyses and graphical visualizations. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Access control; Decision theory; Cryptographic key; Defense mechanism; Graphical visualization; Information leakage; Multi-stage attack; Optimal strategies; Policy mechanisms; Technical community; Game theory",,,,,,,,"Blackwell, D., (1949) The Noisy Duel, One Bullet Each, Arbitrary Accuracy, , Technical report, The RAND Corporation, D-442; Bowers, K.D., Dijk, M., Griffin, R., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., Triandopoulos, N., Defending against the unknown enemy: Applying FlipIt to system security (2012) Gamesec 2012.

This paper introduces a methodology to optimize 3-dimensional long-hail aircraft trajectories in a wind field with the aim of minimizing the flight time in which the formation of persistent condensation trails may take place, whilst taking into account the effects on flight time and total fuel burn. For this purpose, an advanced optimization algorithm based on optimal control theory was combined with a point-mass aircraft model, an atmospheric model based on historic weather data and a model to predict the formation of persistent condensation trails. An example scenario of a long-haul flight between Amsterdan and Washington D.C. is presented indicating significant potential for the reduction of radiative forcing at relatively small cost in terms of fuel and flight time. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The reasons are a higher complexity and vulnerability of infrastructures in combination with the pressure of being cost-effective, as well as the availability of more evolving attack techniques. New and sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threats cannot be detected using common security measures like signature-based detection. New techniques for detection in CRITIS are necessary. As one part of a comprehensive detection framework for CRITIS we introduce PRoCeeD – Process secuRity by using Causal Data. Our approach combines methodologies from control theory, distributed computing and automata theory. The goal is to create a mathematical model of the nodes, i.e. Programmable Logic Controller or other control systems. Furthermore this is done in an automated fashion using existing information like the Source Code, input and output values like network traffic and process variables and data models. The generated model can be simulated in conjunction with on-line data of a running process to predict probable process states. A combination of this prediction with an anomaly detection framework can reveal attacks, misuses or errors that cannot be detected using common security measures. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Anomaly detection (attacks, misuse, errors) in CRITIS; Automation security; Cyber security in CRITIS; Industrial process security","Complex networks; Cost effectiveness; Discrete event simulation; Distributed computer systems; Forecasting; Signal detection; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection frameworks; Automation security; Cyber security; Detection framework; Discrete event models; Industrial processs; Signature based detections; Critical infrastructures",,,,,"European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","The authors would like to acknowledge the funding of the research project STEUERUNG by the senate of the state Berlin and the European Regional Development Fund.

As APT attacks are often launched by well funded entities that are persistent and stealthy in achieving their goals, they are highly challenging to combat in a cost-effective way. The situation becomes even worse when a sophisticated attacker is further assisted by an insider with privileged access to the inside information. Although stealthy attacks and insider threats have been considered separately in previous works, the coupling of the two is not well understood. As both types of threats are incentive driven, game theory provides a proper tool to understand the fundamental tradeoffs involved. In this paper, we propose the first three-player attacker-defender-insider game to model the strategic interactions among the three parties. Our game extends the two-player FlipIt game model for stealthy takeover by introducing an insider that can trade information to the attacker for a profit. We characterize the subgame perfect equilibria of the game with the defender as the leader and the attacker and the insider as the followers, under two different information trading processes. We make various observations and discuss approaches for achieving more efficient defense in the face of both APT and insider threats. © 2015 IEEE.","Computational modeling; Computer security; Face; Games; Numerical models; Real-time systems","Commerce; Computation theory; Computer games; Cost effectiveness; Interactive computer systems; Military communications; Numerical models; Real time systems; Security of data; Computational model; Cost effective; Cyber security; Face; Games; Insider Threat; Strategic interactions; Three-party; Game theory",,,,,,,,"(2013) ESET and Sucuri Uncover Linux/Cdorked.

The QSPR models are developed using molecular descriptors computed through quantum mechanical methods including ab-initio as well as advanced semi-empirical methods. The predictivity of the developed models is tested through state-of-the-art external validation procedures employing an external prediction set of compounds. To analyse the role of instantaneous interactions between electrons (the electron-correlation), the models are also compared with those developed using only the electron-correlation contribution of the quantum chemical descriptor. The electron-correlation contribution towards the chemical hardness and the LUMO energy are observed to be the best predictors for octanol-water partition coefficient, whereas for the octanol-air partition coefficient, the total electronic energy and electron-correlation energy are found to be reliable descriptors, in fact, even better than the polarisability. For aqueous solubility of PCNs, the absolute electronegativity is observed to be the best predictor. This work suggests that the electron-correlation contribution of a quantum-chemical descriptor can be used as a reliable indicator for physico-chemical properties, particularly the partition coefficients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aqueous solubility; Electron-correlation; Partition-coefficients; Persistent organic pollutants; QSPR; Quantum chemical descriptors","Chemical bonds; Electron correlations; Electronegativity; Electrons; Naphthalene; Organic pollutants; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Solubility; Aqueous solubility; Partition coefficient; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); QSPR; Quantum chemical descriptors; Indicators (chemical); octanol; polychlorinated naphthalene; water; chlorinated hydrocarbon; naphthalene derivative; pollutant; aqueous solution; correlation; empirical analysis; naphthalene; partition coefficient; physicochemical property; ab initio calculation; Article; chemical structure; controlled study; dipole; electron; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; quantitative structure property relation; solubility; analysis; chemical model; chemistry; pollutant; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum theory; Electrons; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Models, Chemical; Naphthalenes; Physicochemical Phenomena; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Quantum Theory; Solubility",,"octanol, 111-87-5, 29063-28-3; water, 7732-18-5; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Naphthalenes",,,"42-313/2013

Additionally, new malware strains appear at a higher rate than ever before. Since many of these malware evade existing security products, traditional defenses deployed by enterprises today often fail at detecting infections at an early stage. We address the problem of detecting early-stage APT infection by proposing a new framework based on belief propagation inspired from graph theory. We demonstrate that our techniques perform well on two large datasets. We achieve high accuracy on two months of DNS logs released by Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), which include APT infection attacks simulated by LANL domain experts. We also apply our algorithms to 38TB of web proxy logs collected at the border of a large enterprise and identify hundreds of malicious domains overlooked by state-of-the-art security products. © 2015 IEEE.","Advanced Persistent Threats; Belief Propagation; Data Analysis","Computer crime; Data flow analysis; Data reduction; Graph theory; Internet service providers; Advanced Persistent Threats; Belief propagation; Domain experts; High-accuracy; Large datasets; Large enterprise; Security products; State of the art; Malware",,,,,,,,"(2013) Hackers in China Attacked the Times for Last 4 Months, , http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html; (2014) Target's Data Breach: The Commercialization of APT, , http://www.securityweek.com/targets-data-breach-commercialization-apt; (2014), http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/, Verizon 2014 data breach investigations report; Antonakakis, M., Perdisci, R., Dagon, D., Lee, W., Feamster, N., Building a dynamic reputation system for DNS (2010) Proc. 19th USENIX Security Symposium; Antonakakis, M., Perdisci, R., Lee, W., Vasiloglou, N., II, Dagon, D., Detecting malware domains at the upper DNS hierarchy (2011) Proc. 20th USENIX Security Symposium; Antonakakis, M., Perdisci, R., Nadji, Y., Vasiloglou, N., Abu-Nimeh, S., Lee, W., Dagon, D., From throw-away traffic to bots: Detecting the rise of DGA-based malware (2012) Proc. 21st USENIX Security Symposium; Bilge, L., Balzarotti, D., Robertson, W., Kirda, E., Kruegel, C., DISCLOSURE: Detecting botnet Command-and-Control servers through large-scale NetFlow analysis (2012) Proc. 28th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, ACSAC; Bilge, L., Kirda, E., Christopher, K., Balduzzi, M., EXPOSURE: Finding malicious domains using passive DNS analysis (2011) Proc. 18th Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security, NDSS; Carter, K.M., Idika, N., Streilein, W.W., Probabilistic threat propagation for network security (2014) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 9; (2012) Command and Control in the Fifth Domain, , http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5APTC2InTheFifthDomain.pdf, Command Five Pty Ltd; (2012), http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/the-mirage-campaign/, Dell SecureWorks.

This approach to education has resulted in many considerable changes in the traditional ""status quo"" of e-Education. This chapter presents a literature review of major revamped principles of Learning Theories and Models that occurred in the early 21st century and reinforced the vast majority of CSCL pursuits and capabilities. It adopts Stahl's (2000) theoretical model to articulate a novel framework for e-Education in VWs. The meaning and contribution of this approach to education will be more understandable through the analysis of collaborative learning climate conditions in the 3D technologically advanced environments based on the interests, demands, and needs of trained users. © 2016, IGI Global.

A novel inorganic organic hybrid Ca2P2O7:Dy3+ phosphor has been fabricated by Pechini method. The optical property of synthesized phosphor is successfully altered by the in corporation of polystyrene sulfonic acid as capping agent in the colloidal solution. The phase purity and the average particle size of the prepared phosphor were calculated from X-ray diffraction (XRD) employing Debye Scherrer method. The morphological and chemical investigations were carried out through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The radiative transitions are explained on the basis of Judd-Ofelt theory and on the basis of derived parameters, the radiative lifetime of persistent hybrid Ca2P2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is calculated as 5.33 ms. This paper explores the mechanism leading to high photoluminescence efficiency using organic capping additives. The photoluminescence (PL) graphs reveal broad band emission at 482 nm (blue) and 573 nm (yellow) corresponding to 4F9/2-6H15/2 and 4F9/2-6H13/2 transitions of Dy3+, respectively. The Commission International De I-Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity co-ordinates were calculated from emission spectra and the values (x, y) were approaching to standard value of white emission. The synthesized pyrophosphate phosphors can thereby account in multiple potential applications including white light emitting diodes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Capping agent; Judd-ofelt radiative transitions; Organic-inorganic ligand and phosphor; Photoluminescence","Chemical analysis; Emission spectroscopy; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Judd-Ofelt theory; Optoelectronic devices; organic-inorganic materials; Particle size; Phosphors; Photoluminescence; Polystyrenes; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Capping agent; Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS); Organic-inorganic; Organic-inorganic hybrid materials; Photoluminescence efficiency; Polystyrene sulfonic acid; Radiative transitions; White light emitting diodes; Optical properties",,,,,,,,"Coates, J., Sammes, P.G., West, R.M., (1996) J.

One of the methods used for computing topological characteristics of a space at different spatial resolutions is persistent homology. This concept can also be applied to network theory, and more specifically to protein-protein interaction networks, where the number of rings in an individual cancer network represents a measure of complexity. Results: We observed a linear correlation of R = -0.55 between persistent homology and 5-year survival of patients with a variety of cancers. This relationship was used to predict the proteins within a protein-protein interaction network with the most impact on cancer progression. By re-computing the persistent homology after computationally removing an individual node (protein) from the protein-protein interaction network, we were able to evaluate whether such an inhibition would lead to improvement in patient survival. The power of this approach lied in its ability to identify the effects of inhibition of multiple proteins and in the ability to expose whether the effect of a single inhibition may be amplified by inhibition of other proteins. More importantly, we illustrate specific examples of persistent homology calculations, which correctly predict the survival benefit observed effects in clinical trials using inhibitors of the identified molecular target. Conclusions: We propose that computational approaches such as persistent homology may be used in the future for selection of molecular therapies in clinic. The technique uses a mathematical algorithm to evaluate the node (protein) whose inhibition has the highest potential to reduce network complexity. The greater the drop in persistent homology, the greater reduction in network complexity, and thus a larger potential for survival benefit. We hope that the use of advanced mathematics in medicine will provide timely information about the best drug combination for patients, and avoid the expense associated with an unsuccessful clinical trial, where drug(s) did not show a survival benefit. © 2015 Benzekry et al.","Betti number; Cancer; Persistent homology; Protein interaction networks; Topology","algorithm; biology; clinical trial (topic); computer simulation; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; metabolism; Neoplasms; probability; protein analysis; signal transduction; theoretical model; Algorithms; Clinical Trials as Topic; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasms; Probability; Protein Interaction Mapping; Signal Transduction",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

On the other hand, cyber-physical systems and cloudcontrolled devices are subject to numerous design challenges; among them is that of security. In particular, recent advances in adversary technology pose Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) which may stealthily and completely compromise a cyber system. In this paper, we design a framework for the security of cloud-based systems that specifies when a device should trust commands from the cloud which may be compromised. This interaction can be considered as a game between three players: a cloud defender/administrator, an attacker, and a device. We use traditional signaling games to model the interaction between the cloud and the device, and we use the recently proposed FlipIt game to model the struggle between the defender and attacker for control of the cloud. Because attacks upon the cloud can occur without knowledge of the defender, we assume that strategies in both games are picked according to prior commitment. This framework requires a new equilibrium concept, which we call Gestalt Equilibrium, a fixed-point that expresses the interdependence of the signaling and FlipIt games. We present the solution to this fixed-point problem under certain parameter cases, and illustrate an example application of cloud control of an unmanned vehicle. Our results contribute to the growing understanding of cloud-controlled systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Computation theory; Cost effectiveness; Decision theory; Embedded systems; Computational process; Controlled system; Cyber infrastructures; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber physicals; Design challenges; Fixed-point problem; Physical devices; Game theory",,,,,,,,"Delphi Automotive, , http://www.delphi.com/delphi-drive, Delphi drive; Mirium-Webster, , http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gestalt, Gestalt; Aström, K.J., Murray, R.M., (2010) Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Baheti, R., Gill, H., Cyber-physical systems (2011) The Impact of Control Technology, 12, pp. 161-166; Bhardwaj, S., Jain, L., Jain, S., Cloud computing: A study of infrastructure as a service (IAAS) (2010) Int.

In this paper we discussed metrics in social networking such as clustering coefficient, cohesion, reach and rediality. Social network graph theory is related to link analysis, structural analysis and centrality measures; we also concentrated on Numerical formulations and simulations using datasets which are used for analysis of social network.Risks, Threats and vulnerabilities on social network areinterrelated to social engineering and part of Advanced Persistent Threat. Security approaches and defense methods are discussed, developed and proved.Mathematical and Statistical theorems are developed with respect to the Algorithmic approach for social networks security in social cloud platform. Social Patterns are the components and pieces of interactivity that are the building blocks of social experiences. We focused on the electronic connections and social tools that are changing the way that we interact with one another, which are designed and simplified to expand online experiences in social networks. We did considerations as practical approach where we applied statistical tools on network data and data analysis is given.

In turn, these emerging theories have catapulted new treatments, such as therapeutic neuroscience education (TNE) and graded motor imagery (GMI), to the forefront of treating people suffering from persistent spinal pain. In line with their increased use, both of these approaches have exponentially gathered increasing evidence to support their use. For example, various random- ised controlled trials and systematic reviews have shown that teaching patients more about the biology and physiology of their pain experience leads to positive changes in pain, pain catastrophization, function, physical movement and healthcare utilisation. Graded motor imagery, in turn, has shown increasing evidence to help pain and disability in complex pain states such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Most research using TNE and GMI has focussed on chronic low back pain (CLBP) and CRPS and none of these advanced pain treatments have been trialled on the thoracic spine. This lack of research and writings in regards to the thoracic spine is not unique to pain science, but also in manual therapy. There are, however, very unique pain neuroscience issues that skilled manual therapists may find clinically meaningful when treating a patient struggling with persistent thoracic pain. Utilising the latest understanding of pain neuroscience, three key clinical chronic thoracic issues will be discussed - hypersensitisation of intercostal nerves, posterior primary rami nerves mimicking Cloward areas and mechanical and sensitisation issues of the spinal dura in the thoracic spine. © W.

In addition, we review the research needed on the psychology of users that poses risks to users from cyber-attacks. For the latter, we review the available theory at the individual and group levels that may help individual users, groups and organizations take actions against cyber threats. We end with future research needs and conclusions. In our discussion, we first agreed that cyber threats are making cyber environments more complex and uncomfortable for average users; second, we concluded that various factors are important (e.g., timely actions are often necessary in cyber space to counter the threats of the attacks that commonly occur at internet speeds, but also the ‘slowand low’attacks that are difficult to detect, threats that occur only after pre-specified conditions have been satisfied that trigger an unsuspecting attack). Third, we concluded that advanced persistent threats (APTs) pose a risk to users but also to national security (viz., the persistent threats posed by other Nations). Fourth, we contend that using “red” teams to search cyber defenses for vulnerabilities encourages users and organizations to better defend themselves. Fifth, the current state of theory leaves many questions unanswered that researchers must pursue to mitigate or neutralize present and future threats. Lastly, we agree with the literature that cyber space has had a dramatic impact on American life and that the cyber domain is a breeding ground for disorder. However, we also believe that actions by users and researchers can be taken to stay safe and ahead of existing and future threats. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,,,,,,,,"Abramson, M., (2014) Learning Temporal User Profiles of Web Browsing Behavior, , Proceedings of the 6th ASE Conference on Social Computing; Abramson, M., Aha, D.W., (2013) Authentication from Web Browsing Behavior, , , FLAIRS Conference; Adelson, E.H., (2000) Lightness Perceptions and Lightness Illusions, , The new cognitive sciences, 2nd Ed.

Recent research in neuroplasticity-based therapeutics shows that neural systems supporting core cognitive skills improve after targeted cognitive training, suggesting that social cognition, and concomitant social functioning, may be improved by targeting the neural systems supporting social cognition. However, the success of this approach depends on the extent to which the social brain is malleable. We review the neural effects of training programs focused on improving social cognition in healthy, schizophrenia, and other clinical samples.Recent findings The current literature suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition show neuroplastic changes after behavioral training and these neural changes confer concomitant benefits to social cognition and social behavior. Most research in schizophrenia has focused on emotion recognition, and although emotion recognition training has behavioral and neural benefits for schizophrenia, more advanced social cognitive processes need to be examined.Summary The data suggest that targeting neural systems underlying social cognition through socially focused behavioral interventions may improve social functioning impairments in schizophrenia. Questions remain regarding how to optimize training, which should be addressed in future work. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

APTs often use a variety of attack methods to get unauthorized system access initially and then gradually spread throughout the network. In contrast to traditional attacks, they are not used to interrupt services but primarily to steal intellectual property, sensitive internal business and legal documents and other data. If an attack on a system is successful, timely detection is of paramount importance to mitigate its impact and prohibit APTs from further spreading. However, recent security incidents, such as Operation Shady Rat, Operation Red October or the discovery of MiniDuke - just to name a few - have impressively demonstrated that current security mechanisms are mostly insufficient to prohibit targeted and customized attacks. This paper therefore proposes a novel anomaly detection approach which is a promising basis for modern intrusion detection systems. In contrast to other common approaches, which apply a kind of black-list approach and consider only actions and behaviour that match to well-known attack patterns and signatures of malware traces, our system works with a white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behaviour over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. In this work, we describe this system in theory and show evaluation results from a pilot study under real-world conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Also the Earth’s climate seems to present a signature of multiple astronomical harmonics. Herein I address some critiques claiming that planetary harmonics would not appear in the data. I will show that careful and improved analysis of the available data do support the planetary theory of solar and climate variation also in the critiqued cases. In particular, I show that: (1) high-resolution cosmogenic 10Be and 14C solar activity proxy records both during the Holocene and during the Marine Interglacial Stage 9.3 (MIS 9.3), 325–336 kyear ago, present four common spectral peaks (confidence level ⪆95 %) at about 103, 115, 130 and 150 years (this is the frequency band that generates Maunder and Dalton like grand solar minima) that can be deduced from a simple solar model based on a generic non-linear coupling between planetary and solar harmonics; (2) time-frequency analysis and advanced minimum variance distortion-less response (MVDR) magnitude squared coherence analysis confirm the existence of persistent astronomical harmonics in the climate records at the decadal and multidecadal scales when used with an appropriate window lenght (L≈110 years) to guarantee a sufficient spectral resolution to solve at least the major astronomical harmonics. The optimum theoretical window length deducible from astronomical considerations alone is, however, L⪆178.4 years because the planetary frequencies are harmonics of such a period. However, this length is larger than the available 164-year temperature signal. Thus, the best coherence test can be currently made only using a single window as long as the temperature instrumental record and comparing directly the temperature and astronomical spectra as done in Scafetta (J. Atmos. Sol. Terr. Phys. 72(13):951–970, 2010) and reconfirmed here. The existence of a spectral coherence between planetary, solar and climatic oscillations is confirmed at the following periods: 5.2 year, 5.93 year, 6.62 year, 7.42 year, 9.1 year (main lunar tidal cycle), 10.4 year (related to the 9.93–10.87–11.86 year solar cycle harmonics), 13.8-15.0 year, ∼20 year, ∼30 year and ∼61 year, 103 year, 115 year, 130 year, 150 year and about 1000 year. This work responds to the critiques of Cauquoin et al. (Astron. Astrophys. 561:A132, 2014), who ignored alternative planetary theories of solar variations, and of Holm (J. Atmos. Sol. Terr. Phys. 110–111:23–27, 2014a), who used inadequate physical and time frequency analyses of the data. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Planetary oscillations; Solar oscillations; Spectral analysis; Synchronization",,,,,,,,,"Abreu, J.A., Beer, J., Ferriz-Mas, A., McCracken, K.G., Steinhilber, F., Is there a planetary influence on solar activity?

Theories and concepts are often explored using simulation and modeling techniques within labs or on small scale testbeds. However, while such testbeds are valuable resources for the research process, these facilities alone cannot provide an appropriate approximation of the real world conditions required to explore ideas at scale. Very large scale global, experimental network research capabilities are required to deeply investigate innovative concepts. For many years, network testbeds were created to address fairly specific, well defined, limited research goals, and they were implemented for fairly short periods. Recently, taking advantage of a number of macro information technology trends, such as virtualization and programmable resources, several network research communities have been developing innovative types of network research environments. Instead of designing traditional network testbeds, research communities are designing large scale, highly flexible distributed platforms that can be used to create many different types of testbeds. Also, rather than creating short term testbeds for limited research objectives, these new environments are being designed as long term persistent resources to support many types of experimental research. This paper describes the motivations for this trend, provides several examples of large scale distributed network research environments based on the Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) and the StarLight Exchange Facility, including the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI), and indicates emerging future trends for these types of environments. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic network provisioning; Experimental network environments; Experimental network testbeds; GENI; Global Lambda Integrated Facility; Network research; OpenFlow; Optical networking; Programmable networks; SDN","Experiments; Information technology; Network architecture; Dynamic network; GENI; Network environments; Network testbeds; Openflow; Optical networking; Programmable network; SDN; Testbeds",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0962997

Not only are second language (L2) researchers applying psycholinguistic theories to SLA, but they are also using experimental techniques historically associated with psychology such as eye tracking to better understand how humans process languages. Most psycholinguistic studies investigating L2 processing of morphology and syntax in adult populations have focused on intermediate, advanced, and near-native learners (see, e.g., Jegerski 2010 for an overview of near-native studies). The few studies examining morphological processing in beginners focus on the first hours of exposure (Rast 2008), or the cognitive and neural mechanisms guiding artificial language learning (e.g., DeKeyser 1997; de Graaff 1997; DeDiego-Balaguer, Fuentemilla and Rodríguez-Fornells 2011). This neglect of novice learners is particularly evident in studies on morphological processing of natural languages on account of adults' persistent difficulty in processing inflectional markers (e.g., Hopp 2013; Slabakova 2008; VanPatten, Keating and Leeser 2012). In effect, the few online morphological studies that include adult beginners show that they lack sensitivity to morphosyntactic agreement violations (see Sagarra and Herschensohn 2013 for a review). However, interestingly, it is also found that sensitivity increases not only with higher proficiency but also with higher working memory span (e.g., Sagarra 2008; Sagarra and Herschensohn 2013), less complex linguistic systems (e.g., Ellis and Sagarra 2011), and cognitively easier structures (e.g., Han and Liu 2013). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,,,,"Bardovi-Harlig, K., (2000) Tense and Aspect in Second Language Acquisition: Form, Meaning, and Use, , Oxford: Blackwell; Bardovi-Harlig, K., The use of adverbials and natural order in the development of temporal expression (2009) IRAL, 30 (4), pp. 299-320; Bates, E., MacWhinney, B., Functionalist approaches to grammar (1982) Language Acquisition: The State of The Art, pp. 173-218. , E.

There is a significant long-run positive relationship between prices and interest rates for the core commodity standard countries. Keynes ([1930] 1971) labelled this positive relationship the 'Gibson Paradox'. A number of theories have been put forward as possible explanations of the paradox but they do not fit the long-run pattern of the relationship. We find that a formal model in the spirit of Wicksell (1907) and Keynes ([1930] 1971) offers an explanation for the paradox: where the need to stabilise the banking sector's reserve ratio, in the presence of an uncertain 'natural' rate, can lead to persistent deviations of the market rate of interest from its 'natural' level and consequently long-run swings in the price level. © 2014 European Association for Banking and Financial History e.V.","Gibson's Paradox; interest rates; Keynes-Wicksell; prices",,,,,,,,,"Ashton, T.S., (1959) Economic Fluctuations in England 1700-1800, , London: Oxford University Press; Barro, R.J., Government spending, interest rates, prices and budget deficits in the United Kingdom, 1701-1918 (1987) Journal of Monetary Economics, 20, pp. 221-247; Barsky, R.B., The Fisher effect and the forecastability and persistence of inflation (1987) Journal of Monetary Economics, 19, pp. 3-24; Barsky, R.B., Summers, L.H., Gibson's paradox and the gold standard (1988) Journal of Political Economy, 96, pp. 528-550; Benjamin, D.K., Kochin, L.A., War, prices and interest rates: A martial solution to Gibson's paradox (1984) A Retrospective on the Classical Gold Standard 1821-11, p. 31. , In M.

APT is a combination of past attacks, not a new one. It's different from any one of previous attacks. Predicting the attack path of APT exactly would be a breakthrough for the future defense in Internet of things. Firstly, the paper proposes classifications of attack and defense for game model from the perspective of game theory. Then, we present the OAPG model, which uses attack path of APT as the attacker's strategy.

Researchers at RSA proposed the FlipIt game to study the impact of such stealthy takeovers. In the basic FlipIt game, an attacker and a defender fight over a single resource; in practice, however, systems typically consist of multiple resources that can be targeted. In this paper, we present FlipThem, a generalization of FlipIt to multiple resources. To formulate the players’ goals and study their best strategies, we introduce two control models: in the AND model, the attacker has to compromise all resources in order to take over the entire system, while in the OR model, she has to compromise only one. Our analytical and numerical results provide practical recommendations for defenders. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Advanced persistent threats; Attacker-defender games; FlipIt; Game theory; Targeted attacks","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Advanced persistent threats; Attacker-defender games; Entire system; FlipIt; Multiple resources; Numerical results; Practical recommendation; Targeted attacks; Game theory",,,,,"CNS-1238959",,,"Bowers, K.D., Van Dijk, M., Griffin, R., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., Triandopoulos, N., Defending against the unknown enemy: Applying flipIt to system security (2012) GameSec 2012.

Currently, human (imagery) analysts process huge data collections from full motion video (FMV) for data exploitation and analysis (real-time and forensic), providing slow and inaccurate results. An Automated Data Exploitation System (ADES) is urgently needed. In this paper, we present a recently developed ADES for airborne vehicles under heavy urban background clutter conditions. This system includes four processes: (1) fast image registration, stabilization, and mosaicking; (2) advanced non-linear morphological moving target detection; (3) robust multiple target (vehicles, dismounts, and human) tracking (up to 100 target tracks); and (4) moving or static target/object recognition (super-resolution). Test results with real FMV data indicate that our ADES can reliably detect, track, and recognize multiple vehicles under heavy urban background clutters. Furthermore, our example shows that ADES as a baseline platform can provide capability for vehicle abnormal behavior detection to help imagery analysts quickly trace down potential threats and crimes. © 2014 SPIE.",,"Clutter (information theory); Vehicles; Abnormal behavior detections; Airborne vehicles; Fast image registration; Full motion video; Moving target detection; Persistent surveillance; Terrorist attacks; Unmanned airborne vehicles; Target tracking",,,,,,,,"Chen, H.-W., Braunreiter, D., Healy, D., Advanced image registration techniques and applications (2008) SPIE Defense &Security Symposium, Proceedings of Independent Component Analyses, Wavelets, Unsupervised Nano-Biomimetic Sensors and Neural Networks VI, 6979, pp. OX01-OX14. , Orlando, FL, 17-19 March; Chen, H.-W., Volpe, C., Tarnowski, M., Snarski, S., Robust extended target detection using non-linear morphological operations (2010) SPIE Defense &Security Symposium, Proceedings of Ground/Air Multi-Sensor Interoperability, Integration, and Networking for Persistent ISR, 7694, pp. 1H01-1H12. , Orlando, FL 5-9 April; Chen, H.-W., Braunreiter, D., Robust image-domain target tracking and recognition process under heavy urban background clutter conditions (2009) SPIE Defense, Security, &Sensing Symposium, Acquisition, Tracking, Pointing, and Laser Systems Technologies XXIII, 7338, pp. 0M01-0M11. , Orlando, FL 13-17 April; Chen, H.-W., Braunreiter, D., Image domain moving target tracking with advanced image registration and time-differencing techniques (2009) SPIE Defense, Security, &Sensing Symposium, Acquisition, Tracking, Pointing, and Laser Systems Technologies XXIII, 7338, pp. 0C01-0C11. , Orlando, FL 13-17 April; Chen, H.-W., Braunreiter, D., Advanced super-resolution image enhancement process (2008) SPIE Optics &Photonics, Proceedings of Applications of Digital Image Processing XXXI, 7073, pp. 1B01-1B10. , San Diego, CA, 10-14 August; Soille, P., (1999) Morphological Image Analysis: Principles and Applications, pp. 170-171. , Springer-Verlag; (2002) Digital Image Processing, , Gonzalez and Woods Second Edition, Prentice Hall, ©; Haykin, S., (1986) Adaptive Filter Theory, , Prentice-Hall Inc; Chen, H.-W., Sutha, S., Olson, T., Target detection and recognition improvements using spatiotemporal fusion (2004) Journal of Applied Optics, 43 (2), pp. 403-415. , January; Lowe, D.G., Distinctive image feature from scale-invariant keypoints (2004) International Journal of Computer Vision, 60, pp. 91-110; Bradski, G., Kaehler, A., (2008) Learning OpenCV-Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library, , O'Reilly",,,"The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","SPIE","Geospatial InfoFusion and Video Analytics IV; and Motion Imagery for ISR and Situational Awareness II","5 May 2014 through 6 May 2014","Baltimore, MD",106945,0277786X,9781628410266,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905747015

The phase-type models are advanced as a flexible family of latent-class models with interpretable components. These models are now supported by computational statistical methods that make numerical calculation of likelihoods and statistical estimation of parameters feasible in theory for quite complicated settings. However, consideration of Fisher Information and likelihood-ratio type tests to discriminate between model families indicates that only the simplest phase-type model topologies can be stably estimated in practice, even on rather large datasets. An example of a parametric model with features of mixtures, multiple stages or 'hits', and a trapping-state is given to illustrate simple computational tools in R, both on simulated data and on a large SEER 1992-2002 breast-cancer dataset. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","EM algorithm;

We examine these alternative threat hypotheses by assessing the potential influence that recent increases in economic inequality and the substantial rise in the Hispanic population in the United States may have had on efforts to control crime. Using an advanced estimation technique to isolate the determinants of police force size in a large sample of U.S. cities between 1980 and 2010, we find that racial threat and economic inequality work both independently and jointly to produce substantial shifts in the size of police forces after accounting for levels of crime as well as other important demographic and structural characteristics. Furthermore, period interactions suggest that racial threat appears to have expanded over the last several decades. Together, our study uncovers novel interactive effects and identifies shifts over time, thus refining existing theoretical assumptions.

For instance, attackers launching an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) can steal full cryptographic keys, violating the very secrecy of ""secret"" keys that cryptographers assume in designing secure protocols. In this article, we introduce a game-theoretic framework for modeling various computer security scenarios prevalent today, including targeted attacks. We are particularly interested in situations in which an attacker periodically compromises a system or critical resource completely, learns all its secret information and is not immediately detected by the system owner or defender. We propose a two-player game between an attacker and defender called FlipIt or The Game of ""Stealthy Takeover."" In FlipIt, players compete to control a shared resource. Unlike most existing games, FlipIt allows players to move at any given time, taking control of the resource. The identity of the player controlling the resource, however, is not revealed until a player actually moves. To move, a player pays a certain move cost. The objective of each player is to control the resource a large fraction of time, while minimizing his total move cost. FlipIt provides a simple and elegant framework in which we can formally reason about the interaction between attackers and defenders in practical scenarios. In this article, we restrict ourselves to games in which one of the players (the defender) plays with a renewal strategy, one in which the intervals between consecutive moves are chosen independently and uniformly at random from a fixed probability distribution. We consider attacker strategies ranging in increasing sophistication from simple periodic strategies (with moves spaced at equal time intervals) to more complex adaptive strategies, in which moves are determined based on feedback received during the game. For different classes of strategies employed by the attacker, we determine strongly dominant strategies for both players (when they exist), strategies that achieve higher benefit than all other strategies in a particular class. When strongly dominant strategies do not exist, our goal is to characterize the residual game consisting of strategies that are not strongly dominated by other strategies. We also prove equivalence or strict inclusion of certain classes of strategies under different conditions. Our analysis of different FlipIt variants teaches cryptographers, system designers, and the community at large some valuable lessons: 1. Systems should be designed under the assumption of repeated total compromise, including theft of cryptographic keys. FlipIt provides guidance on how to implement a cost-effective defensive strategy. 2. Aggressive play by one player can motivate the opponent to drop out of the game (essentially not to play at all). Therefore, moving fast is a good defensive strategy, but it can only be implemented if move costs are low. We believe that virtualization has a huge potential in this respect. 3. Close monitoring of one's resources is beneficial in detecting potential attacks faster, gaining insight into attacker's strategies, and scheduling defensive moves more effectively. Interestingly, FlipIt finds applications in other security realms besides modeling of targeted attacks. Examples include cryptographic key rotation, password changing policies, refreshing virtual machines, and cloud auditing. © 2012 International Association for Cryptologic Research.","Advanced persistent threats; FlipIt; Game theory; Repeated stealthy takeovers; Security modeling","Advanced persistent threats; Critical resources; Cryptographic primitives; Defensive strategies; FlipIt; Repeated stealthy takeovers; Secret information; Security model; Costs; Game theory; Probability distributions; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Equivalence classes",,,,,,,,"Cloud Security Alliance, , www.cloudaudit.org; Ateniese, G., Burns, R., Curtmola, R., Herring, J., Kissner, L., Peterson, Z., Song, D., Provable data possession at untrusted stores (2007) Proc. 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS); Bowers, K.D., Juels, A., Oprea, A., HAIL: A high-availability and integrity layer for cloud storage (2009) Proc. 16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS); Bowers, K.D., Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R., Remote assessment of fault tolerance (2011) Proc. 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS); Chan, D.Y., Vasarhelyi, M.A., Innovation and practice of continuous auditing (2011) Int.

Different factors that affect this process are compared: irradiation source, load of catalyst, initial concentration of KP, pH, concentration of dissolved oxygen, addition of co-oxidants, and the presence of tert-butanol as HO scavenger. The fastest degradation of KP, with a rate constant (42±3)×10-4s-1, was obtained under UV irradiation in air atmosphere, using 1.2gL-1 of 20-MWCNT-TiO2. Composites of 20-MWCNT-TiO2 also afforded the fastest degradation with UVA-vis irradiation, in the absence of oxygen, with a rate constant (13.6±0.7)×10-4s-1. In this case, 60% mineralization of KP was observed after 30min. Gibbs free energies, pKa values, and the standard reduction potential of KP and related species, calculated by DFT (6-311G(d,p)), are in agreement with the observed behavior.A feasible degradation mechanism is proposed, both for the photolysis and photocatalyzed processes. Similar transient species are involved, both routes leading to similar photoproducts, the main is (3-ethylphenyl)(phenyl)methanone (m/. z=. 211. g/mol), resulting from decarboxylation of KP. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced oxidation processes; Carbon nanotubes; Density functional theory (DFT); Heterogeneous photocatalysis; Ketoprofen; Persistent organic pollutants; Pharmaceuticals; Photoproducts; Reaction mechanism; SMD model","Advanced Oxidation Processes; Heterogeneous photocatalysis; Ketoprofen; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Photoproducts; Reaction mechanism; Carbon nanotubes; Carboxylation; Degradation; Density functional theory; Drug products; Irradiation; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Organic pollutants; Photocatalysis; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Rate constants; Titanium dioxide",,,,,"Universal Display Corporation, UDC

The metric is computed from an oriented subgraph of the underlying cyber network induced by selecting only those edges for which a given property holds between the two vertices of the edge. The metric with respect to a select node on the subgraph is defined as the likelihood that the select node is reachable from another arbitrary node in the graph. This metric can be calculated dynamically from the authorization and auditing layers during the network security authorization phase and will potentially enable predictive deterrence against attacks such as PTH. © 2013 IEEE.","cybersecurity; discrete mathematics; graph theory","Cyber security; Discrete mathematics; Graph-analytic; Lateral movement; Subgraphs; Information science; Mathematical techniques; Network security; Graph theory",,,,,,,,"Barratt, A., Barthelemy, M., Vespignani, A., (2008) Dynamic Processes on Complex Networks, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Ashton, P., (1997), http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/233/info, April 8 NT ""pass the hash"" with modified smb client vulnerability; Chung, F., Lu, L., Complex graphs and networks (2006) Regional Conference Series in Mathematics, (107). , Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences, American Mathematical Society; Costa, L.D.F., Inward and Outward Node Accessibility in Complex Networks As Revealed by Non-Linear Dynamics, , physics.soc-ph (arXiv:0801.1982v1); Eppstein, D., Galil, Z., Italiano, G., Dynamic graph algorithms (1999) Algorithms and Theoretical Computing Handbook, , M.

This approach to education has resulted in many considerable changes in the traditional ""status quo"" of e-Education. This chapter presents a literature review of major revamped principles of Learning Theories and Models that occurred in the early 21st century and reinforced the vast majority of CSCL pursuits and capabilities. It adopts Stahl's (2000) theoretical model to articulate a novel framework for e-Education in VWs. The meaning and contribution of this approach to education will be more understandable through the analysis of collaborative learning climate conditions in the 3D technologically advanced environments based on the interests, demands, and needs of trained users. © 2014 by IGI Global.

Patients and Methods: Data were retrieved from three large, randomized, controlled trials of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer in patients with stage III and two trials in patients with stage IV melanoma. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for females compared with males, adjusted for different sets of confounders for stage III and stage IV, respectively. Results: In 2,734 stage III patients, females had a superior 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rate compared with males (51.5% v 43.3%), an adjusted HR for DSS of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.95), and an adjusted HR for relapse-free survival of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.95). In 1,306 stage IV patients, females also exhibited an advantage in DSS (2-year survival rate, 14.1% v 19.0%; adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.92) as well as for progression-free survival (adjusted HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.88). This female advantage was consistent across pre- and postmenopausal age categories and across different prognostic subgroups. However, the female advantage seems to become smaller in patients with higher metastatic tumor load. Conclusion: The persistent independent female advantage, even after metastasis to lymph nodes and distant sites, contradicts theories about sex behavioral differences as an explanation for this phenomenon. A biologic sex trait seems to profoundly influence melanoma progression and survival, even in advanced disease. © 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"cisplatin; dacarbazine; interferon;

We investigate associative learning explanations that involve the blocking of later experienced cues by earlier learned ones in the first language (L1; i.e., transfer) and the L2 (i.e., proficiency). Sagarra (2008) and Ellis and Sagarra (2010b) found that, unlike Spanish monolinguals, intermediate English-Spanish learners rely more on salient adverbs than on less salient verb inflections, but it is not clear whether this preference is a result of a default or a L1-based strategy. To address this question, 120 English (poor morphology) and Romanian (rich morphology) learners of Spanish (rich morphology) and 98 English, Romanian, and Spanish monolinguals read sentences in L2 Spanish (or their L1 in the case of the monolinguals) containing adverb-verb and verb-adverb congruencies or incongruencies and chose one of four pictures after each sentence (i.e., two that competed for meaning and two for form). Eye-tracking data revealed significant effects for (a) sensitivity (all participants were sensitive to tense incongruencies), (b) cue location in the sentence (participants spent more time at their preferred cue, regardless of its position), (c) L1 experience (morphologically rich L1 learners and monolinguals looked longer at verbs than morphologically poor L1 learners and monolinguals), and (d) L2 experience (low-proficiency learners read more slowly and regressed longer than high-proficiency learners). We conclude that intermediate and advanced learners are sensitive to tense incongruencies and-like native speakers-tend to rely more heavily on verbs if their L1 is morphologically rich. These findings reinforce theories that support transfer effects such as the unified competition model and the associative learning model but do not contradict Clahsen and Felser's (2006a) shallow structure hypothesis because the target structure was morphological agreement rather than syntactic agreement.

Despite controversy as to the underlying mechanisms, cortical hyperexcitability appears to be closely related to the interplay between excitatory corticomotoneurons and inhibitory interneurons. Hyperexcitability is not a static phenomenon but rather shows a pattern of progression in a spatiotemporal aspect. Cortical hyperexcitability may serve as a trigger to the development of anterior horn cell degeneration through a 'dying forward' process. Hyperexcitability appears to develop during the early disease stages and gradually disappears in the advanced stages of the disease, linked to the destruction of corticomotorneuronal pathways. As such, a more precise interpretation of these unique processes may provide new insight regarding the pathophysiology of ALS and its clinical features. Recently developed technologies such as threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation and automated nerve excitability tests have provided some clues about underlying pathophysiological processes linked to hyperexcitability. Additionally, these novel techniques have enabled clinicians to use the specific finding of hyperexcitability as a useful diagnostic biomarker, enabling clarification of various ALS-mimic syndromes, and the prediction of disease development in pre-symptomatic carriers of familial ALS. In terms of nerve excitability tests for peripheral nerves, an increase in persistent Na+ conductances has been identified as a major determinant of peripheral hyperexcitability in ALS, inversely correlated with the survival in ALS. As such, the present Review will focus primarily on the puzzling theory of hyperexcitability in ALS and summarize clinical and pathophysiological implications for current and future ALS research. © 2013 Korean Neurological Association.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Corticomotoneuron; Gamma-aminobutyric acid; Hyperexcitability; Interneuron",,,,,,,,,"Kiernan, M.C., Vucic, S., Cheah, B.C., Turner, M.R., Eisen, A., Hardiman, O., Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2011) Lancet, 377, pp. 942-955; Kiernan, M.C., Hyperexcitability, persistent Na+ conductances and neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2009) Exp Neurol, 218, pp. 1-4; Section, I., Alphabetic list of terms with definitions (2001) Muscle Nerve, 24, pp. S5-S28; Kleine, B.U., Stegeman, D.F., Schelhaas, H.J., Zwarts, M.J., Firing pattern of fasciculations in ALS: Evidence for axonal and neuronal origin (2008) Neurology, 70, pp. 353-359; Swash, M., Why are upper motor neuron signs difficult to elicit in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?

Neogeography, in contrast to 'established geography', especially uses the argument that it is for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Similar arguments have been used to praise the growth in Web GIS since the mid-1990s and seem to be persistent in the conceptualisation of these technologies. However, what is the nature of this democracy, and to what extent do the technologies that are used in neogeography fulf l this democratisation promise? In this contribution the framework of ered by Andrew Feenberg in his critical theory of technology, and especially his call for 'deep democratisation', is used to provide a critique of these assertions of the nature of neogeography. The analysis shows that, unlike early critical GIS and the literature on participatory GIS, the analysis of neogeography adopted an instrumentalist interpretation of the technology and its applications. This view claims that technology is value free and that there is a separation between means and ends. This type of argument ignores and disguises the values that are integrated inexorably in advanced technologies. Once the values are exposed and discussed, neogeography becomes far less exciting and transformative. It becomes clear that there is a separation between a technological elite and a wider group of uninformed, labouring participants who are not empowered through the use of the technology. There are also multiple obstacles that limit the democratic potential of neogeography. The analysis progresses by considering the hierarchy of hacking, understood here as the ability to alter and change the meaning and use of a specific technological system. This hierarchy further explains the democratisation potentialities and limits of neogeography. Because of the reduced barriers, neogeography does offer some increased level of democratisation but, to fulfil this potential, it requires careful implementation that takes into account social and political aspects.","Deep democratisation; Democratisation; Hacker culture; Neogeography; Participatory GIS; Philosophy of technology",,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/I025278/1",,,"Batty, M., Virtual geographies (1997) Futures, 29, pp. 337-352; Bellamy-Foster, J., McChesney, R.W., The Internet unholy marriage with capitalism (2011) Monthly Review, 62 (10). , http://monthlyreview.org/110301foster-mcchesney.php; Borsook, P., (2000) Cyberselfi Sh-A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian World of High Tech, , Little, Brown and Company, London; Budhathoki, N.R., Haklay, M., Nedovic-Budic, Z., (2010) Who are the mappers and why do they map in OpenStreetMap?

The authors of this book propose a systematic analysis of the set-theoretic elements and devise approaches which exploit advanced elements within the field. The main idea is to translate fault detection and isolation conditions into those conditions involving sets. Furthermore, these are to be computed efficiently using positive invariance and reachability notions. Constraints imposed by exact fault control are used to define feasible references (which impose persistent excitation and, thus, non-convex feasible sets). Particular attention is given to the reciprocal influences between fault detection and isolation on the one hand, and control reconfiguration on the other. © ISTE Ltd 2013.

Well-known researchers who have worked to establish productive, sustainable connections between the knowledge produced by the research community and the practices employed in school settings provide descriptions of successful strategies that have been used to bridge the gap among theory, research, and practice.The volume addresses three main themes:*analysis of how educational theory and research may be used to improve student learning and achievement in mathematics, science, and reading;*examination of how educational theory and research has been used to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate the effects of challenges of large-scale reform; and*exploration of how different models of intelligence and creativity have informed educational practice.Viewed as a collective effort to translate theory and research into educational practice, the interventions and programs described by the contributors to this volume represent nearly 200 years of work. As a compendium of successful strategies, this book will help others identify ways to make their own research more useful to their practice communities. As an investigation of persistent, seemingly intractable problems encountered when attempting to connect theory and research to the everyday work of teachers and students in classrooms, the analyses presented in this volume demonstrate where additional work is needed. By examining critical, persistent challenges encountered when attempting to connect educational theory and research to the everyday work of teachers in classrooms and schools, this book will help improve the practical value of educational research and help chart the course for future research.Translating Theory and Research into Educational Practice is intended as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses across the discipline of education and should be particularly relevant for classes dealing with educational research, educational policy, and teaching and learning. The book is equally relevant for various communities interested in improving connections between research and practice, including educational researchers, educational psychologists, psychologists, teachers, other educational professionals such as state school officers, district officials, and policy makers. The authors' comprehensive descriptions and critical reflections will provide readers with valuable insights about the practical demands, theoretical complexities, and political realties associated with efforts to translate theory and research into effective educational practice. © 2006 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

He has little need for conventional theory; rather, he reframes essential analytic notions - transference, resistance, interpretation, regression, empathy - as processes and assigns technique the goal of promoting the patient’s activity within the treatment situation. The aim of the analytic therapist is to restore to the patient active control of his own life.Utilizing basic premises of systems theory, Schlesinger approaches personality and neurosis alike as self-stabilizing systems that can be changed only with persistent effort. Follow-up interpretations that address the patient’s responses to previous interpretations are crucial. Similarly, the analyst views the transference as “rules of behavior” the patient has created that limit the freedom of both parties in the treatment. Interpretation speaks to the patient’s inability to make full use of the freedom the analytic situation affords to explore how his mind works. Viewing neuroses as what the patient does, rather than what he has, the analyst sees the “resisting” patient not as opposing the treatment but rather doing what the patient feels he must do both to accommodate to the demands of the script of an unconscious fantasy and to provide for his own sense of safety.Beautifully illustrated with clinical vignettes and everyday social experiences, The Texture of Treatment is a lucid and engaging presentation of the principles Schlesinger has taught to successive generations of psychiatric residents, clinical psychology interns, clinical social work students, and psychoanalytic candidates. Taking up elementary matters from an advanced point of view, he has produced a contemporary text whose appeal to seasoned clinicians will be no less that its usefulness to beginning therapists. © 2003 by The Analytic Press, Inc., Publishers.

As a comparison, the adsorption of 4,4'-DCB on graphene oxide (GO) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was also studied under the same experimental conditions. PG performs significantly better with regard to 4,4'-DCB adsorption than GO and MWCNTs, or any reported nanomaterials, with a maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 1552 mg g-1 at pH 7.0. The high affinity of 4,4'-DCB to PG is mainly a result of strong π-π interactions, as also confirmed by DFT calculations. The results reveal that PG sheets hold promise for the removal of persistent organic pollutants. We expect possible applications of this fast and mild plasma technique in the fabrication of nanomaterials and envisage their use in a variety of advanced chemical processes.

With attacks today showing ever increasing sophistication, however, this tenet is eroding. ""Advanced Persistent Threats"" (APTs), for instance, leverage zero-day exploits and extensive system knowledge to achieve full compromise of cryptographic keys and other secrets. Such compromise is often silent, with defenders failing to detect the loss of private keys critical to protection of their systems. The growing virulence of today's threats clearly calls for new models of defenders' goals and abilities. In this paper, we explore applications of FlipIt, a novel game-theoretic model of system defense introduced in [14]. In FlipIt, an attacker periodically gains complete control of a system, with the unique feature that system compromises are stealthy, i.e., not immediately detected by the system owner, called the defender. We distill out several lessons from our study of FlipIt and demonstrate their application to several real-world problems, including password reset policies, key rotation, VM refresh and cloud auditing. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Complete control; Cryptographic key; Cryptographic systems; Game-theoretic model; Password reset; Private key; Real-world problem; System knowledge; System security; Unique features; Knowledge management; Game theory",,,,,,,,"Ateniese, G., Burns, R., Curtmola, R., Herring, J., Kissner, L., Peterson, Z., Song, D., Provable data possession at untrusted stores Proc. 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security, CCS (2007); Barker, E., Barker, W., Polk, W., Smid, M., Recommendation for key management II: Best practices for key management organization (2005) NIST SP, (2-3), pp. 1-79; Juels, A., Kaliski, B., PORs: Proofs of retrievability for large files (2007) Proc. 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS), pp. 584-597; Katz, J., Bridging Game Theory and Cryptography: Recent Results and Future Directions (2008) LNCS, 4948, pp. 251-272. , Canetti, R.

In this paper we propose a game-theoretic modelling of a particular form of security assessment - one which addresses the question ""are we compromised?"". We do so by extending the recently proposed game ""FlipIt"", which itself can be used to model the interaction between defenders and attackers under the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) scenario. Our extension gives players the option to ""test"" the state of the game before making a move. This allows one to study the scenario in which organisations have the option to perform periodic security assessments of such nature, and the benefits they may bring. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Digital assets; Game-theoretic; Integral part; IT infrastructures; Security assessment; Critical infrastructures; Game theory",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/K006010/1",,,"Bejtlich, R., (2012) Testimony before the USCC Hearing on ""Developments in China's Cyber and Nuclear Capabilities"", , http://www.uscc.gov/hearings/2012hearings/writtentestimonies/hr120326.php, March 26; Billo, C.G., (2004) Cyber Warfare: An Analysis of the Means and Motivations of Selected Nation States, , Technical report, Institute for Security Technology Studies at Darthmouth College; Böhme, R., Félegyházi, M., Optimal Information Security Investment with Penetration Testing (2010) LNCS, 6442, pp. 21-37. , Alpcan, T., Buttyán, L., Baras, J.S.

By switching the rounding parameter s from zero to one, one can smoothly interpolate between cubes with sharp edges and hard spheres. The equilibrium phase diagram of rounded parallel hard cubes is computed as a function of their volume fraction and the rounding parameter s. The second order freezing transition known for oriented cubes at s = 0 is found to be persistent up to s = 0.65. The fluid freezes into a simple-cubic crystal which exhibits a large vacancy concentration. Upon a further increase of s, the continuous freezing is replaced by a first-order transition into either a sheared simple cubic lattice or a deformed face-centered cubic lattice with two possible unit cells: body-centered orthorhombic or base-centered monoclinic. In principle, a system of parallel cubes could be realized in experiments on colloids using advanced synthesis techniques and a combination of external fields. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",,"Equilibrium phase diagrams; External fields; Face-centered cubic lattices; First order transitions; Freezing transition; Hard spheres; Rounded edge; Second orders; Sharp edges; Simple-cubic lattices; Synthesis techniques; Three dimensional systems; Unit cells; Vacancy concentration; Computer simulation; Density functional theory; Geometry; Phase diagrams; Freezing",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","We thank Klaus Mecke, Marjolein Dijkstra, Laura Filion, and Frank Smallenburg for useful discussions.

Lately, MPC has not been limited only to slow processes, where there is plenty of time for calculations between successive time-steps, but it has also been gaining ground in the field of fast processes. That said, when dealing with control problems involving complex dynamics, computational complexity still remains the main issue. The complex hybrid and nonlinear nature of many processes that are met in practice causes problems with both structure modelling and parameter identification; therefore, obtaining a model that is suitable for MPC is often a difficult task. Classic modelling and especially identification methods that originate from linear-system theory are inadequate for treating such systems. In addition, the methods dealing modelling and identification of hybrid nonlinear systems tend to yield too complex models that are thus inappropriate for MPC. Hence, the need for special methods and formulations when dealing with hybrid nonlinear systems is very clear. In this chapter we employ a hybrid fuzzy model (HFM) for modelling complex systems for control purposes in practice. However, it is often difficult to identify a complex hybrid nonlinear system and formulate it as HFM. The identification method presented in this chapter strives to overcome this obstacle by using a fuzzy clustering algorithm for identification purposes and projecting the resulting clusters defined in the input-output space of the HFM DIO into the input space of the HFM DI. In this manner, it is possible to derive a HFM that is suitable for MPC purposes. We verified the identification approach on a hybrid nonlinear batch reactor example. The batch reactor is used in pharmacetical industry for preparation of medicines, where rapid and precise control of temperature of the ingredients in the core is required. The results suggest that the batch reactor can be efficiently identified and formulated as a HFM, which can eventually be used in a MPC algorithm. Furthermore, the presented identification approach yields a significantly more accurate model comparing to the approach that does not involve the fuzzy clustering algorithm. We treat MPC of a class of hybrid nonlinear systems that can be modelled as a HFM, which presents a convenient framework for dealing with such systems. The MPC approach is based on the development of a tree of evolution involving a reachability analysis. It is a sort of branch-and-bound method which returns the optimal solution based on a pre-defined criterion. The obtained HFM was employed in the MPC algorithm based on a reachability analysis presented in this chapter. We have ascertained that the reference temperature is well followed by the actual core temperature. In addition, the persistent output disturbance is well compensated by the algorithm, which further proves the usability of the MPC algorithm combined with the HFM framework for control of such hybrid nonlinear systems. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Because they keep kernel code and persistent hooks intact, they can evade detection of state-of-the-art kernel integrity monitors. Moreover, they have been used by advanced malware such as the Rustock spam bot to achieve malicious goals. In this paper, we present a systematic defense against such novel attacks. We propose the Precise Lookahead Checking of function Pointers approach that checks the legitimacy of pending K-Queue callback requests by proactively checking function pointers that may be invoked by the callback function. To facilitate the derivation of specifications for any K-Queue, we build a unified static analysis framework and a toolset that can derive from kernel source code properties of legitimate K-Queue requests and turn them into source code for the runtime checker. We implement proof-of-concept runtime checkers for four K-Queues in Linux and perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation of these checkers, which shows that our defense is effective against KQH attacks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was coordinated around a one-week module on electrical circuit theory, with the concept inventory administered immediately before and after the module. Students were also given an open-ended questionnaire during the pre-test, and a survey to evaluate the instructional module with the post-test. We discuss details of the instructional module and present several findings from our analysis of the survey data. We find that while a majority of the students had completed Advanced Placement (AP) physics and/or electronics courses and were currently enrolled in college-level physics courses, they still had many difficulties solving basic problems involving resistive circuits and did not show significant improvements after completing the instructional module. Our findings highlight many of the persistent difficulties faced by students in this conceptual domain. Factors such as prior educational experiences and intended major (i.e., ECE vs. non-ECE) were shown to predict student performance on the concept inventory. We conclude the paper by first describing how this study has informed a new stage of research involving a more in-depth qualitative study of misconceptions in this domain, including across student levels (i.e., first-year to junior/senior). We also discuss how a number of insights from this study can help instructors and curriculum developers assess and improve conceptual understanding in the context of their own courses. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.","Circuits; Concept inventory; Conceptual understanding; DC; DIRECT; Direct current; Electrical engineering; Student perceptions","Circuit theory; Education; Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Networks (circuits); Surveys; Timing circuits; Concept inventories; Conceptual understanding; DIRECT; Direct current; Student perceptions; Students",,,,,,,,"Chi, M.T.H., Slotta, J.D., De Leeuw, N., From things to processes: A theory of conceptual change for learning science concepts (1994) Learning and Instruction, 4, pp. 27-43; Sangam, D., Jesiek, B., Circuit concept inventories: A comparative analysis (2010) American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) Anuual Conference and Exposition, , Louisville, KY; Engelhardt, P.V., Beichner, R.J., Students' understanding of direct current resistive electrical circuits (2004) Am.

It aims to illustrate how the bureaucratic imperative explains much about the ascendancy of certain actors to positions of prominence on the peace-building landscape, and the types of activities that these actors engage in. In line with world polity theory, it is interested in the construction and institutionalization of discourses, understandings, expectations and practices of peace-building. It argues that there has been a 'technocratic turn' in relation to peace-building, whereby there has been a gradual but persistent trend towards the application of technocracy in the framing of conflict and approaches to it. Two key claims advanced on behalf of technocracy - neutrality and efficiency - are discussed. The article then argues that a complex mix of structural and proximate factors have reinforced the technocratic turn in peace-building. It concludes by considering the extent to which the discursive framing of conflict by key actors predetermines their conflict response. The article is primarily an exercise in conceptual scoping, though it can also be read as a contribution to the critique of the liberal peace and considerations of resistance and agency in peace-building contexts. © The Author(s) 2012.","Bureaucracy; peacebuilding; statebuilding; technocratic",,,,,,,,,"Abbinett, R., (2006) Marxism After Modernity: Politics, Technology and Social Transformation, , Basingstoke: Palgrave; Amir, S., Symbolic power in a technocratic regime: The reign of BJ Habibie in New Order Indonesia (2007) Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia, 22 (1), pp. 83-106; Anderson, M.B., (1999) Do No Harm: How Aid Can Support Peace, , Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner; Annan, K., (2005) In Larger Freedom: Towards Security, Development and Human Rights for All.

Populations across the globe have come to depend on success at school for establishing careers and gaining access to post-school qualifications. Yet large numbers of young people are excluded from the advantages that successful completion of school brings and as a result are subjected to consequences such as higher likelihood of unemployment, lower earnings, greater dependence on welfare and poorer physical health and well-being. Over recent decades, most western nations have stepped up their efforts to reduce drop out and raise school completion rates while maintaining high standards. How school systems have approached this, and how successful they are, varies. This book compares the various approaches by evaluating their impact on rates of dropout and completion. Case studies of national systems are used to highlight the different approaches including institutional arrangements and the various alternative secondary school programs and their outcomes. The evaluation is based on several key questions: What are the main approaches? How do they work? For whom do they work? And, how successful are they in promoting high rates of completion and equivalent outcomes for all? This book examines the nature of the dropout problem in advanced industrialized countries with the goal of developing a broader, international understanding that can feed into public policy to help improve completion rates worldwide. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"Centre for Post-Compulsory Education and Lifelong Learning, , Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia",,,"Springer Netherlands",,,,,,9789048197620,,,"English","Sch.

There continues to be a persistent need to develop the analytics to capture both the explicit and implicit risks inherent in such domains. A Value-based Time-phased Bayesian Network (VTBN) extends a conventional Bayesian Network (BN) by including features from a Dynamic Bayesian Network such as temporal risk factors that are enhanced by Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT). The proposed VTBN integrates the quantitative analytic constructs of BNs and MAVT with the qualitative formalism of a structured hazard taxonomy. The enhanced methodology provides a framework for the systematic inclusion of the explicit risk inherent from the BN and the non-apparent implicit risk in the BN that exists in large complex systems. Preliminary modeling results suggest that VTBNs offer promise for advanced risk assessment, particularly for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) where civilian data are especially sparse. In this paper, the analytic constructs of a VTBN are demonstrated with an application of safety risk modeling to aid in the prioritization of a portfolio of mitigations for a futuristic UAS scenario. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

In detail, two kinds of organizational pride exist. First, service employees can experience short, persistent affective emotions of pride based on the perception of a successful event related to the organization. Second, employees can have a cognitive and durable attitude of pride resulting from the general perception of the organization. Prior research neglects not only to analyze empirically the relationship between emotional organizational pride and attitudinal organizational pride, but also to examine positive effects from them. The objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship and the effects of the two kinds of organizational pride with commitment to customer service, creativity and turnover intention. Design/methodology/approach: The first study is an exploratory pre-study and deals with spontaneous impressions of 53 customer consultants regarding their emotional and attitudinal organizational pride. Data used for the main study were collected through an online panel provider. A sample of 733 service employees was generated and structural equation modeling was applied to test the hypotheses. Findings: Results from the main study suggest that there is a strong relationship between emotional organizational pride and attitudinal organizational pride. Whereas the former has a direct, positive effect on commitment to customer service and creativity, the latter directly influences commitment to customer service and turnover intention. An indirect effect on creativity was also found. Research limitations/implications: To reduce the complexity of the model, no moderating variables were integrated. In a subsequent step, it is important to analyze empirically the drivers and conduct a longitudinal analysis to test the relationship between the two kinds of organizational pride and their effects over time. Practical implications: The measurement and management of organizational pride are vital sources for improving service behaviors; they represent new challenges for service-oriented human resource management. Originality/value: The paper is novel for three reasons. First, the affective events theory (AET) is advanced by additional substantial relationships. Second, links between the two kinds of organizational pride are analyzed for the first time. Finally, the paper suggests empirical evidence for the positive effects of the two kinds of organizational pride. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Affective events theory (AET); Attitudinal organizational pride; Commitment to customer service; Creativity; Emotional organizational pride; Employee attitudes; Employee behaviour; Turnover intention",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Nature and operation of attitudes (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 27-58; Ajzen, I., (2005) Attitudes, Personality and Behavior, , Open University Press, Oxford, 2nd ed; Anfuso, D., 3M's staffing strategy promotes productivity and pride (1995) Personnel Journal, 74 (2), pp. 28-34; Appleberg, K.A., The construction of a nomological network for organizational pride (2005), dissertation, Benedictine University, Chicago, IL; Arbuckle, J.L., (2008) AMOS 17.0 User's Guide, , Amos Development Corporation, Chicago, IL; Arnett, D.B., Laverie, D.A., McLane, C., Using job satisfaction and pride as internal-marketing tools (2002) Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 43 (2), pp. 87-96; Bagozzi, R., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Bagozzi, R.P., Wong, N., Yi, Y., The role of culture and gender in the relationship between positive and negative affect (1999) Cognition and Emotion, 13 (6), pp. 641-672; Basch, J., Fisher, C., Affective events-emotions matrix: A classification of work events and associated emotions (2000) Emotions in the Workplace, pp. 36-48. , Ashkanasy, N.M., Härtel, C.E.J., Zerbe, W.J.

Experiments conducted in the physiological O 2 concentration range, where initial hydrogen atom abstraction from the fatty acid occurs in a kinetically reversible manner, are described. Our findings indicate that O 2-trapping of an α-carbon radical is likely to reversibly precede reduction of a 2-(R)-peroxyl radical intermediate in the first irreversible step. A mechanism of concerted proton-coupled electron transfer is proposed on the basis of natural abundance oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effects, deuterium kinetic isotope effects, and calculations at the density functional level of theory, which predict a polarized transition state in which electron transfer is advanced to a greater extent than proton transfer. The approach outlined should be useful for identifying mechanisms of concerted proton-coupled electron transfer in a variety of oxygen-utilizing enzymes. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon radicals; Computational investigation; Concentration ranges; Density-functional level; Deuterium kinetic isotope effect; Electron transfer; Hydrogen atom abstraction; Kinetic isotope effects; Natural abundance; Oxygen reactivity; Oxygen-18; Oxygenases; Peroxyl radical; Polarized transition state; Proton-coupled electron transfer; Stereospecific; Tyrosyl radicals; Carrier mobility; Catalytic oxidation; Density functional theory; Deuterium; Electron transitions; Free radical reactions; Kinetics; Oxygen; Porphyrins; Protons; Fatty acids; deuterium; dioxygenase; fatty acid; heme; hydrogen; oxygen; oxygen 18; peroxy radical; radical; article; catalysis; chemical structure; density functional theory; electron transport; kinetics; oxidation; priority journal; proton transport; reduction; stereospecificity; Binding, Competitive; Diffusion; Dioxygenases; Electron Transport; Fatty Acids; Free Radicals; Heme; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Oryza sativa; Oxygen; Oxygen Isotopes; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Quantum Theory; Solvents; Stereoisomerism; Substrate Specificity; Tyrosine; Viscosity",,"deuterium, 7782-39-0; dioxygenase, 37292-90-3; heme, 14875-96-8; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; oxygen 18, 14797-71-8; Dioxygenases, 1.13.11.-; Fatty Acids; Free Radicals; Heme, 14875-96-8; Oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen Isotopes; Solvents; Tyrosine, 55520-40-6",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0952054",,,"Koeduka, T., Matsui, K., Akakabe, Y., Kajiwara, T., Catalytic properties of rice α-oxygenase.

The first concept, mainly static, is an invitation to compare the equilibrium of the really existent eco nom ies against the ideal type of a highly theor et ical pure market eco nomy. The second one stresses the dynamic nature of this spe- cific social polit ical and eco nomic regime (Heilbroner 1988). This includes ques- tions such as why such a contra dict ory eco nomic sys tem might be structurally stable. What are the factors that shape its techno lo gical and institutional trans- forma tions? Can one expect that national eco nom ies will converge toward the same institutional configuration? Since the emergence of industrial capit al ism, the same questions seem to have been asked by authors who have investigated the successive trans forma tion of capit al ism. Basically, during each his tor ical period a specific national eco nomy has been taken as the em blem atic configura- tion of con tempor ary capitalisms. Until now, fin an cial globalization has not been instrumental in promoting a convergence of macro economic evolutions and institutional configurations. There remains persistent evid ence of the exist ence of different brands of capit al ism. Among them, the Chinese eco nomy is now the focus of many researchers and it has been prompting a provocative question: should China be con sidered the model rel ev ant for most de veloping coun tries? Such a question once more points to the dangers of an overestimation of the merits of a successful brand of capit al ism and to an underestimation of the path dependency of the various brands of capit al ism. It is thus im port ant to try to understand the present configuration of the Chinese eco nomy in the light of the liter at ure that deals with the variety/diversity of capitalisms. The Chinese case thus is espe cially inter esting concerning the issue of diversity. First, it is clear that Chinese capit al ism is not a replication of the Amer ican config- uration, as their emerging complementarities at the inter na tional level have shown. The issue of a renewed diversity of con tempor ary capit al ism has to take into account the Chinese ex peri ence. Second, the large size and extreme regional and organ iza tional diversity observed in China make this coun try an em blem atic case study, in order to understand how some regu larities emerge at the national level in spite of pronounced heterogeneity in tech no logy, stand ard of livings, eco nomic specialization. If one sticks to the official line of the Chinese authorities, China is still a form of socialist eco nomy. However, it is easy to find evid ence of a typ ic ally capitalist configuration and this is re-launching the debate about the nature and evolution of capit al isms. It is an invitation to ana lyse how successive, seem- ingly mar ginal and minor reforms have been pro gressively converting a Soviet type eco nomy into a new brand of capit al ism. The layering of institutional forms and the com peti tion among a large number of local state corporations imply an extreme diversity of local configurations and heterogeneity of firms’ legal status and work organ iza tion. This is a challenge to the variety of capit alism approach that postulates a one-to-one corres pond ence between firms’ organ iza tion and institutional forms operating at the macro level. Nevertheless, regulation theory has been recently extended in order to take into account the pos sible co-existence of various private-publically owned organ iza tions within the same macro institutional architecture. This framework characterizes China as a competition-led regime and such a characterization has definite consequences concerning the insertion of this coun try into the world eco nomy. This leads to a number of questions. Will the social and eco nomic pol icies decided in response thecon tempor ary crisis drastically change the very nature of Chinese institutional architecture? Should China be con sidered as a new brand of capit al ism by contrast with Western advanced eco nom ies? Is Chinese capit al ism unique or does it share some features with other Asian capit al isms? This is an invitation to extend the research agenda about the renewed diversity/variety of capit al isms. © 2012 Christel Lane and Geoffrey T.

This paper calls its historical consciousness ""time of a nation"" - a consciousness that meaningful capitalist development or modernization must be initiated by a nation not by a ruling political power or specific class. In the 1970s, the key writers of Changjak-gwa bipyeong took a stand against the trend that supported the urban- and elites-centered literature and advanced the ""theory of peasant literature"" (nongmin munhangnon) and contributed to forming the framework of ""the people and the intellectual."" The intellectual movements led by Changjak-gwa bipyeong in this period highlighted critics and historians with adequate historical consciousness as the most awakened citizens and, thus, emphasized the need for persistent critical writing as a vital practice for intellectuals.","Capitalism; Changjak-gwa bipyeong (Changbi); Cheongmaek; Kim Yong-Sup; Korean division system; Paik Nak-chung; Silhak; South Korea; Theory of internal development; Time of a nation; Time of capital",,,,,,,,,"Chung, S., Kim Yong-Sup's Theory of Primitive Accumulation and Development of the Studies of Socioeconomic History (2009) Hanguksa Yeongu (Journal of Korean History), 147; Jeon, S., Formation of Literary Subjects and Sense of Petit Bourgeois - Significance of the Debate over Petit Bourgeois in Terms of Criticism History (2004) Sangheo Hakbo (Sangheo Journal), 13; Kang, M.-G., Discussion on Silhak's Role in the Advancement of People's Life (1973) Munhak-gwa Jiseong (Literature and Intelligence), 14; Kang, M.-G., (1978) Bundan Sidae-ui Yeoksa Insik (Historical Understanding in the Era of Division), , Seoul: Changjak-gwa Bipyeong; Kang, M.-G., (2010) Yeoksaga-ui Sigan: Kang Man-gil Jaseojeon (Time of A Historian: Kang Man-gil's Autobiography), , Seoul: Changbi Publishers; Kim, B.H., (2005) ""Park Chung-hee Jeonggwongi Gyeongje Gaebal - Minjokjuui-wa Baljeon, Geurigo Mosun"" (Economic Development in the Park Chung-hee Regime - Nationalism and Development and Their Contradictions), , PhD diss., Sungkyunkwan University; Kim, D.-C., Korean Social Studies and Changbi for 30 Years: Nation, People, and the World (1996) Changjak-gwa Bipyeong (Creation and Criticism), 91; Kim, J.-I., Internal Development Theory and Nationalism (2010) Yeoksa-wa Hyeonsil (History and Reality), 77; Kim, J.Y., The Division System and the '87 Regime (2009) 87 Nyeon Chejeron (Theory of the '87 Regime), , edited by Kim Jong Yup.

Composing Software Components: A Software-testing Perspective describes a 10-year investigation into the underlying principles of CBSD. By restricting attention to the simplest cases, startling results are obtained: •Components are tested using only executable code. Their behavior is recorded and presented graphically •Functional and non-functional behavior of systems synthesized from components are calculated from component tests alone. No access to components themselves is required •Fast, accurate tools support every aspect of CBSD from design through debugging Case studies of CBSD also illuminate software testing in general, particularly an expanded role for unit testing and the treatment of non-functional software properties. This unique book: •Contains more than a dozen case studies of fully worked-out component synthesis, with revealing insights into fundamental testing issues •Presents an original, fundamental theory of component composition that includes persistent state and concurrency, based on functional software testing rather than proof-of-programs. •Comes with free supporting software with tutorial examples and data for replication of examples. The Perl software has been tested on Linux, Macintosh, and Windows platforms. Full documentation is provided •Includes anecdotes and insights from the author's 50-year career in computing as systems programmer, manager, researcher, and teacher Composing Software Components: A Software-testing Perspective will help software researchers and practitioners to understand the underlying principles of component testing. Advanced students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics can also benefit from the book as a supplemental text and reference. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

Eng., 26, pp. 55-69. , The implementations of this paper are abstract data types written in C++ and the formalism is that of algebraic equations suitably restricted to eliminate difficulties like non-confluence. Its major contribution is Antoy's idea that the abstraction/representation mapping relating the concrete implementation of a data type to its abstract mathematical structure should be explicitly made part of the implementation. This allows random testing to be completely automated, thus extending the ideas of DAISTS [30] and Mills [29]. The example used for illustratation exposes the weakness of random testing in the presence of state that it may fail to use enough long sequences; Basili, V., Turner, A., Iterative enhancement: A practical technique for software development (1975) IEEE Trans. on Softw.

Eng., 19 (1), pp. 3-12. , The clear conclusion of this well-thought-out paper is that 'ultrareliability,' that is, failure rates below about 10?8/run, cannot be investigated using testing. The number of test points required to obtain confidence in ultrareliabilty is too large to be practical, even under the best possible circumstances. The roughly 107 seconds in a work-year are not enough to conduct the roughly 109 necessary test runs. The paper considers a number of ingenious ways to try to get around this stubborn fact, and shows that each must fail. The technical device used to obtain results is hypothesis testing, which makes the derivations more forbidding than need be. Most of the results could be obtained with less statistical machinery using failure-rate bounds and upper confidence bounds as in Chapter 12; Chen, T.Y., Leung, H., Mak, I.K., Adaptive random testing (2004) Proceedings of the 9th Asian Computing Science Conference, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3321, pp. 320-329. , Springer-Verlag; Chen, T.Y., Merkel, R., An upper bound on software testing effectiveness (2008) IEEE Trans. on Softw.

Notes, 27 (4), pp. 191-195; Cobb, R.H., Mills, H.D., Engineering software under statistical quality control (1990) IEEE Software, pp. 44-54. , Although some of the mathematics is garbled in the printed version, this paper makes a good case for prioritizing software failures for attention by frequency of occurrence. The paper popularizes very original work by Adams [1] in which he suggests that many failures are simply not worth fixing-they will probably never occur again. My own experience with operating-system crashes agrees: Bug after bug is fixed, often with great difficulty, but the failure rate of the system hardly improves because there is a large supply of very lowfrequency failures; Cohen, D.M., Dalal, S.R., Fredman, M.L., Patton, G.C., The aetg system: An approach to testing based on combinatorial design (1997) IEEE Trans. on Softw.

Certainly These Papers Are among the Most Important and Difficult in the History of Mathematical Logic. It Is Impossible to Be Sure of the Effect This Work Had on the Development of Electronic Computers in the Following Decade. It Certainly Did Not Suggest How Real Machines Should Be Built- von Neumann's Design Is Nothing Like A Turing Machine or A Post System, Closer in Fact to Babbage's Mechanical Engine-but the Idea That from the Simplest Operations All Possible Computations Can Be Built May Have Been Important Raven Press; Demillo, R.A., Lipton, R.J., Sayward, F.G., Hints on test data selection: Help for the practicing programmer (1978) Computer, 11, pp. 34-41; Duran, J., Ntafos, S., An evaluation of random testing (1984) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 10, pp. 438-444. , Joe Duran was an early and tireless advocate of random testing, whose insights are well expressed in this paper. Its contribution was a way of analyzing subdomain testing (called ""partition testing"" in this and other papers) by simulating its distributions. It is not an exaggeration to say that this paper opened up a new area, generating many similar publications (some say too many), e.g., [55, 11]. The most recent development comes from T-Y. Chen and his co-workers, who are beginning to find fundamental explanations for the limitations of systematic testing [15], and perhaps will be able to unravel the way in which so-called 'faults' are expressed in a program's input space; Ernst, M., Cockrell, J., Griswold, W.G., Notkin, D., Dynamically discovering likely program invariants to support program evolution (2001) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 27, pp. 99-123; Fagan, M.E., Design and code inspections to reduce errors in program development (1976) IBM Systems Journal, 15 (3), pp. 182-211; Floyd, R.W., Assigning meanings to programs (1967) Proceedings Symposium Applied Mathematics, 19, pp. 19-32. , Amer. Math. Soc Floyd's paper is generally credited with originating program proving, although Turing [95, ?A-] and others had provided earlier examples. I first read the paper as a grad student, and I remember telling my thesis advisor that I was sure Floyd was onto something truly wonderful. I had previously written a paper for a class in which I attempted to describe Algol programs in first-order logic, a paper that received a B+ with the comment that the professor (Buzz Hunt) didn't think it was practical, so I was in a position to appreciate just how well Floyd had done. So far, Hunt appears to have been right; Foster, K.A., Error sensitive test cases analysis (estca) (1980) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 6 (3), pp. 258-264. , Foster's background was in hardware testing, and he was seeking to find for software an analogy to hardware tests for so-called 'stuck-at' faults (in fabrication technology that has now changed). It is a lack of fault models-details of how things might go wrong-that makes software testing very different from hardware testing. For hardware the engineer knows what might fail and tests for it; when it's not found all is well. For software the catalog of possible problems seems unlimited, so when all tests succeed it means almost nothing. The difference is that in hardware manufacture the whole point is to control and confine the possibilities for mistakes, but in software the point is to allow a human programmer as much power as possible; Frankl, P.G., Weiss, S.N., An experimental comparison of the effectiveness of branch testing and data flow testing (1993) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 19 (8), pp. 774-787; Frankl, P.G., Weyuker, E.J., An applicable family of data flow testing criteria (1988) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 14, pp. 1483-1498; Gannon, J., Hamlet, D., Mills, H., Theory of modules (1987) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 13, pp. 820-829; Gannon, J., Hamlet, R., McMullin, P., Data abstraction implementation, specification, and testing (1981) ACM Trans. Prog. Lang. and Systems, 3, pp. 211-223; Geller, M.M., Test data as an aid in proving program correctness (1978) Comm. of the ACM, pp. 368-375. , For many years this paper stood alone as a serious attempt to aid program proofs using test data. (Other 'testing/proving' papers were mostly the obverse.) Geller recognized that in special cases a few test points constitute a proof in conjunction with knowledge of the program code. For example, if some part of the code can be seen to be implementing a linear function, it is sufficient to test two points to show that it is the correct line. This kind of analysis is exactly what takes place in the best unit tests. But Geller was able to come up with only a few examples, mostly for the integer data type. The current work in metamorphic testing [16] may be the long-sought generalization of this promising start; Gelprin, D., Hetzel, B., The growth of software testing (1988) Comm. of the ACM, 31 (6), pp. 687-695; Gerhart, S.L., Yelowitz, L., Observations of fallibility in applications of modern programming methodologies (1976) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 2 (3), pp. 195-207; Goodenough, J.B., Gerhart, S.L., Toward a theory of test data selection (1975) IEEE Trans. on Softw. Eng., 1, pp. 156-173. , The tentative title correctly indicates that the authors present only the beginnings of a theory, long on definitions but short on theorems. They assume that programs have neither persistent state nor concurrency. Nevertheless, this paper set the standard for practially all subsequent theoretical work in software testing. It was a revelation because testing was treated using a functional mathematical model, in contrast to other treatments that were merely exposition of practical methods. The exciting prospect that opened up was the possibility of proving results rather than supporting them only with empirical studies. The workshop on Testing And Verification (TAV) first organized by Susan Gerhart and Bill Howden in Ft. Lauderdale, FL in 1979, which eventually evolved into the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA), had this paper and Howden's on subdomain testing [64] as prime motivation; Gorton, I., Heineman, G.T., Crnkovic, I., Schmidt, H.W., Stafford, J.A., Szyperski, C., Component-based software engineering, 9th Int (2006) Symposium, CBSE9, LNCS 4063, , Springer; Guy Steele, J., Woods, D., Finkel, R., Crispin, M., Stallman, R., Goodfellow, G., The Hacker's Dictionary, A guide to the World of Computer Wizards Harper & Row (1983) This Original Version, Like Algol 60 in Hoare's Aphorism, Is A Great Improvement on Its Successor the New Hacker's Dictionary.

Its primary purpose was to investigate the behavior of measurement and prediction errors as subdomains shrink. But long delays in publication and referee demands allowed it to include cases with state (including a minimal theoretical treatment of state), and other case studies, for example on substituting one component for another.

Its example is the design for a program for KWIC indexing, which now also serves the unexpected purpose of keeping this neglected variant of index-making alive. To the modern student, it seems that Parnas is just presenting object-oriented design in an unfamiliar way; this is chronologically reversed, since O-O was barely a glimmer in Alan Kay's and O-J Dahl's eyes when Parnas wrote. His ideas came from software engineering, not programming languages; he was mostly thinking of operating systems written in assembly language; Petroski, H., (1985) To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design, , St. Martin's Press, New York, NY; Sethi, R., A case study in specifying the semantics of a programming language (1980) Proc.

In it he anticipates some of what Floyd [25, ?A-] would publish almost 20 years later.

Object-oriented transactions are also typically missing a fundamental ACID requirement: consistency. We present a developed technology based on object-oriented assertion languages that overcomes these limitations of persistent and database object systems. This technology allows specification of object-oriented integrity constraints, their static verification and dynamic enforcement. Proof strategies that are based on static and dynamic verification techniques as they apply to verification of object-oriented transactions are presented in the paper. Most of this work has been motivated by the problems of object-oriented interfaces to XML that have not been able to express typical XML Schema constraints, database constraints in particular. The components of this technology are an object-oriented constraint language, a verification system with advanced typing and logic capabilities, predefined libraries of object-oriented specification and verification theories, and an extended virtual platform for integrating constraints into the run-time type system and their management. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,"Assertion language; Constraint language; Database constraints; Database objects; Integrating constraints; Integrity constraints; Object oriented; Object-oriented interfaces; Object-oriented specifications; Proof strategy; Run-time types; Schemas; Static and dynamic; Static verification; Technology-based; Verification systems; Virtual platform; XML schemas; Acids; Digital libraries; Embedded systems; Query languages; Specifications; Technology; XML; Object oriented programming",,,,,,,,"Alagić, S., Royer, M., Genericity in Java: Persistent and database system implications (2007) The VLDB Journal, , http://www.springerlink.com/content/a067l813x8p28724/; Alagić, S., Royer, M., Crews, D., Temporal verification of Java-like classes (2006) Proceedings of FTfJP 2006, , http://www.disi.unige.it/person/AnconaD/FTfJP06/; Alagić, S., Royer, M., Briggs, D., Program verification techniques for XML Schema-based technologies (2006) Proceedings of ICSOFT, 2, pp. 86-93; Alagić, S., Royer, M., Next Generation of Virtual Platforms, , http://www.odbms.org/experts.aspx#article4; Alagić, S., Logan, J., Consistency of Java transactions (2004) LNCS, 2921, pp. 71-89. , Lausen, G., Suciu, D.

The disease carries a significantly high morbidity and mortality risk. There are multiple pharmaceutical options to decrease this risk and prolong survival; however, despite optimization of medical management, several patients still await heart transplant, the only definitive cure for heart failure. To slow the progression of disease preventing need for transplantation, improve clinical symptoms, and improve heart failure outcomes, there is a persistent need to discover new therapeutic strategies. Of interest, low growth hormone and testosterone levels have been associated with a worsening degree of heart failure. Many studies have begun to show a clinical improvement in heart failure symptoms when these levels are corrected with hormonal therapy. These findings, although mixed, are promising and indicate that both testosterone and growth hormone therapy should be considered as adjunctive therapy in advanced heart failure patients. Areas covered in this review: This review discusses the physiology of both of these natural hormones, their therapeutic effects in heart failure and data from the published literature on studies using growth hormone or testosterone in patients with chronic heart failure. An extensive search of PubMed was conducted for topics on heart failure, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, testosterone, their physiology and pathophysiology, and trials in which they have been used as therapeutic interventions between 1989 and 2009. What the reader will gain: The reader will gain an understanding of the intricate balance of both of these hormones in the disease state of heart failure. In addition, the trials conducted using these hormones in pharmacotherapy for heart failure are discussed along with proposed theories for interstudy variability. Take home message: Testosterone deficiency and growth hormone resistance are positively associated with a poor state of heart failure. Treatment of deficiency improves outcomes in heart failure; however, there is a significant paucity of data with regard to testosterone and heart failure as well as a significant amount of study variability with growth hormone and heart failure. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.","Growth hormone;

Due to the low ground sampling distance and low frame rate, vehicles usually have small size and may travel a long distance between consecutive frames, WAAS videos pose great challenges to correct associate existing tracks with targets. In this paper, we explore road structure information to regulate both object based vertex matching and pair-wise edge matching schemes in a relational graph. The proposed relational graph approach then unifies these two matching schemes into a single cost minimization framework to produce a quadratic optimized association result. The experiments on hours of real WAAS videos demonstrate the relational graph matching framework effectively improves vehicle tracking performance in large scale dense traffic scenarios. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Persistent wide area airborne surveillance; relational graph; vehicle tracking","Advanced vehicle; Aerial surveillance; Airborne Surveillance; Cost minimization; Edge matching; Frame rate; Ground sampling distances; Long distances; Matching scheme; Object based; Relational graph; Road structures; Small size; Vehicle tracking; Wide area; Graph theory; Monitoring; Optimization; Vehicles; Security systems",,,,,,,"Bar-Shalom, Y., Fortmann, T.E., (1988) Tracking and Data Association, , San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Cour, T., Srinivasan, P., Shi, J., Balanced graph matching (2006) NIPS; Cox, I., Hingorani, S., An efficient implementation of Reid's multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm and its evaluation for the purpose of visual tracking (1996) IEEE Trans.

Although a number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1.intense and persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health. © The University of North Carolina Press.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for supporting the 1996 GSS Emotions Module and the individuals who developed this valuable resource.

Some patients suffer persistent or recurrent symptoms despite receiving optimal medical and surgical treatment. The recent publication of revised diagnostic criteria and management guidelines will assist both clinical research and practice. Multiple theories have been advanced regarding the underlying pathogenesis including allergy, bacterial or fungal infection, genetic predisposition and structural anomalies, but at present the majority of cases are still considered idiopathic. Recent studies have shown that traditional laboratory culture techniques may fail to detect microorganisms growing within biofilms or within host mucosal cells. Both bacteria and fungi possess a number of mechanisms for both the evasion and modulation of host immune responses, including the formation of biofilms and the production of superantigens. Historically, treatments such as antibiotics that had been directed at putative causative agents have often been disappointing. There are, however, a broad range of medical and surgical therapies with proven efficacy available to the treating physician. Endoscopic surgical management is evolving rapidly, and there have been pronounced improvements in outcome and reduction in the risk of complications. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition have led to some promising therapeutic developments, particularly in respect to topical treatments. Despite improvements in therapy, CRS remains a challenging condition to manage.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; antibiotic agent; antifungal agent; antihistaminic agent; antiinfective agent; baby shampoo; budesonide; corticosteroid; decongestive agent; doxycycline; macrolide; mometasone furoate; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; placebo; prednisone; pseudomonic acid; roxithromycin; sodium chloride; steroid; superantigen; unclassified drug; allergic rhinitis; allergy; anaphylaxis; asthma; bacterial infection; bacterium; bacterium culture; biofilm; chornic rhinosinusitis; chronic rhinosinusitis; clinical practice; clinical research; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; debridement; diagnostic procedure; drug bioavailability; drug hypersensitivity; drug sensitivity; endoscopic sinus surgery; endoscopic surgery; endoscopy; epistaxis; fungal sinusitis; fungus; genetic analysis; genetic predisposition; histopathology; human; immune response; immunomodulation; microorganism; mycosis; nasal lavage; nose congestion; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathogenesis; physician; review; rhinosinusitis; risk factor; risk reduction; surgical technique; treatment duration; treatment failure; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Aspirin; Biofilms; Chronic Disease; Drug Hypersensitivity; Humans; Nasal Lavage; Rhinitis; Sinusitis",,"acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; budesonide, 51333-22-3; doxycycline, 10592-13-9, 17086-28-1, 564-25-0; mometasone furoate, 105102-22-5, 83919-23-7; prednisone, 53-03-2; pseudomonic acid, 12650-69-0, 40980-51-6, 71980-98-8; roxithromycin, 80214-83-1; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Aspirin, 50-78-2","aspirin",,,,"Chronic Sinusitis (2002) Summary Health Statistics for US Adults, 2002: US Department of Health and Human Services, , National Center for Health Statistics; Ray, N.F., Baraniuk, J.N., Thamer, M., Healthcare expenditures for sinusitis in 1996: Contributions of asthma, rhinitis, and other airway disorders (1999) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 103 (3 PART 1), pp. 408-414; Gliklich, R.E., Metson, R., The health impact of chronic sinusitis in patients seeking otolaryngologic care (1995) Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 113, pp. 104-109; Scadding, G.K., Durham, S.R., Mirakian, R., BSACI guidelines for the management of rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis (2008) Clin Exp Allergy, 38, pp. 260-275; Fokkens, W., Lund, V., Mullol, J., EPOS 2007: European position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps (2007) Rhinology, 45, pp. 1-139; Polzehl, D., Moeller, P., Riechelmann, H., Distinct features of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps (2006) Allergy, 61, pp. 1275-1279; Ha, K.R., Psaltis, A.J., Tan, L., A sheep model for the study of biofilms in rhinosinusitis.

Such methods have traditionally been used to analyse the stability of rock blocks at free surfaces only. These methods have also been limited to the analysis of relatively few discontinuities, usually assumed to be infinitely persistent.Development of more advanced algorithms has removed these limitations and allowed the development of a modeller capable of handling multiple curved, finite persistent discontinuities. We discuss this modeller and its capability of predicting the existence of polyhedra with unlimited facets and morphologies. This paper describes the use of this polyhedral modeller for the study of the stability of an underground excavation and offers significant advantages over the algorithm recently reported by Menéndez-Díaz et al.

Economic growth is limited by market extent and ecological constraints. The trade-off between stability and complexity is the foundation of cultural diversity and mixed economies. The new science of complexity sheds light on the sources of economic instability and complexity. This book consists of the major work of Professor Ping Chen, a pioneer in studying economic chaos and economic complexity. They are selected from works completed since 1987, including original research on the evolutionary dynamics of the division of labour, empirical and theoretical studies of economic chaos and stochastic models of collective behavior. Offering a new perspective on market instability and the changing world order, the basic pillars in equilibrium economics are challenged by solid evidence of economic complexity and time asymmetry, including Friedman's theory of exogenous money and efficient market, the Frisch model of noise-driven cycles, the Lucas model of microfoundations and rational expectations, the Black-Scholes model of option pricing, and the Coase theory of transaction costs. Throughout, a general theory based on complex evolutionary economics is developed, which integrates different insights from Marx, Marshall, Schumpeter, Keynes and offers a new understanding of the evolutionary history of division of labour.

In this sense, we define an ecosystem linkage as any persistent or recurring process or attribute that connects different ecosystems in some manner. We argue that such linkages are integral, even defining, components of aquatic ecosystem structure and function, and therefore, should be evaluated in the course of ecological studies. J-NABS has made significant contributions to our understanding of such linkages. The percentage of all publications in J-NABS addressing some ecological linkage has approached 10% in recent years. Historically, emphasis was placed on upstream–downstream linkages in flowing waters, and theory (e.g., river continuum, nutrient spiraling) has evolved largely around this phenomenon. However, other linkages among ecosystems have received increased attention in the past 20 y. These linkages include surface–subsurface, lake–stream, river–floodplain, and, more recently, marine–freshwater. We contend that many ecological processes, including primary production, nutrient cycling, organic matter processing, and secondary production, are driven by such exchanges because of the donor-controlled nature of many aquatic ecosystems. Exchanges of materials from aquatic ecosystems to terrestrial systems, caused by flooding, nutrient translocation, or insect emergence, can be substantial. Movement of energy and nutrients from the ocean to freshwaters, such as in the migrations of anadromous fishes, also can be dramatic. Despite increasing evidence of the importance of such linkages, considerable impediments to research, such as journal specialization, lack of interdisciplinary study teams, and limited funding of sufficient duration for such research, exist. Such obstacles are surmountable if investigators continue to emphasize that aquatic ecology will be advanced by the study of such linkages, and that environmental problems are better understood and solved in the context of that knowledge. © 2010 by The North American Benthological Society","Connectivity; Energy flow; Freshwater; Linkage; Marine; Nutrient dynamics; Resource subsidy; Terrestrial","Hexapoda; Pisces",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DEB-0516043","We are extremely grateful to the many individuals who contributed to the ideas and content of this paper. In particular, we thank Jason Keller and Susanne Hebbeler for their heroic efforts in painstakingly examining the published literature and assembling the data that contributed to Fig. 2. We are greatly indebted to them. This manuscript sprang from a NABS Presidential Address delivered by GAL at Prince Edward Island in 1998, but the ideas contained in that address remained dormant for some time. We thank Al Steinman for encouraging us to resurrect them in this paper. A graduate seminar held at the University of Notre Dame contributed substantially to the ideas contained in that address, and Aimee Fullerton assisted with the graphical content of that address. The students and postdoctorates in the University of Notre Dame Stream Ecology Laboratory have, over the past 10 y, generously shared ideas and made suggestions that greatly improved the final manuscript during its considerable gestation period. Robert Hall, Pamela Silver, and 2 anonymous referees made valuable comments on a previous version of this paper, for which we are grateful.

The intent of this review is to supply a framework of clinical practices, ethical principles, legal precedents, and professional guidelines that will impart information and can assist decision making regarding artificial nutrition and hydration. Comprehensive understanding of the theory and practice of informed consent for competent adults, decisionally incompetent adults, and minors is necessary for making valid clinical judgments and for guiding patients and their families or surrogates in choosing options related to initiating, withholding, or withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration. The framework offered in this review can serve as a basis for evaluation of appropriateness of artificial nutrition and hydration in 3 common conditions in which decision making is particularly challenging: terminal illness, advanced dementia, and a persistent vegetative state. The framework facilitates guidance for institutional policy makers and individual nutrition support professionals dealing with situations in which personal values often create ethical dilemmas related to artificial nutrition and hydration and its utility. © 2010 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.","Bioethics; Dementia; Enteral nutrition; Nutritional support; Palliative care","bioethics; clinical practice; dementia; enteric feeding; health care personnel; hospital policy; human; hydration; informed consent; legal aspect; medical decision making; nutritional support; palliative therapy; parenteral nutrition; patient guidance; persistent vegetative state; practice guideline; priority journal; religion; responsibility; review; terminal disease; treatment withdrawal; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Dementia; Ethics, Medical; Fluid Therapy; Humans; Infant; Informed Consent; Nutritional Support; Palliative Care; Persistent Vegetative State; Physician's Practice Patterns; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Terminally Ill",,,,,,,"Teitelbaum D, Guenter P, Howell WH, Kochevar ME, Roth J, Seidner DL.

Using a combination of experimentally and theoretically derived substituent effects, the design, synthesis, isolation, and characterization of the first persistent nonacene derivative is described. The molecular design strategy includes placement of arylthio (or alkylthio) substituents on the terminal rings of the nonacene skeleton, effectively converting an open-shell singlet diradical into a closed-shell system. These powerful substituent effects appear to be suitable for the synthesis of other persistent, soluble, large acene derivatives required for advanced thin-film organic semiconductor applications.

Neo-Marxist work on the time of modernity, for its part, indicates that the dualistic understanding of temporality that structures the trope of feminine timelessness is marked by instabilities and contradictions. Fashion, I argue, makes apparent these instabilities. Approaching the debates on modern temporality through the lens of fashion adds complexity to theories of women's positioning vis-à-vis modernity, showing that women were invoked simultaneously as modernity's antitheses and its exemplars. I suggest that the register of ephemerality advanced by fashion offers a useful framework for understanding the variable visibility of women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. © 2010, SAGE Publications.

Therefore, it is important for the emergency physician to recognize this condition. We report the case of a previously undiagnosed retinoblastoma in a patient who presented to an urban emergency department and review the pertinent literature with regard to initial diagnosis, evaluation, and management of this rare condition, which has yet to be reviewed in the emergency medicine literature. We present the case of an 8-week-old male infant who was brought to the emergency department by his family for eyelid swelling and found to have leukocoria (""white light reflex"") and an irregular pupil. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastomas. Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy of infancy and childhood, with an incidence of 1 in 15 000 live births [1]. It can develop from inactivation of both retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene copies (RB1) on chromosome 13q14. Although most children have an asymptomatic presentation, the most common signs found on physical examination are leukocoria ""white light reflex"" (56%) and strabismus ""cross-eyes"" (24%) [2]. Early detection and recognition of retinoblastoma are strongly correlated with increased patient survival. Therefore, it is important for the emergency physician to recognize this potentially life-threatening condition. A review of the international emergency medicine literature reveals no other previous reports of retinoblastoma being diagnosed from the emergency department (ED). We present the case of a newborn with leukocoria and an irregular pupil who was subsequently diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastomas. An 8-week-old male infant was brought to the ED by his mother and grandfather. They were concerned that the infant was not eating well and that his right eyelid appeared swollen. As per the mother, for 1 day, the child was fussy, had decreased oral intake, and refused to open his right eye. She denied a history of fever, bloody diarrhea, abdominal distention, rashes, discharge from the eye, or any maternal genital tract infections. The infant was born at 39 weeks by cesarean section secondary to fetal decelerations. He had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged home with his mother on the second day of life. His only known history was a heart murmur diagnosed during the first (and only) visit with the pediatrician. He had received the appropriate vaccinations for his gestation. The child was afebrile, well appearing, well nourished, and well hydrated, with age-appropriate behavior. His vital signs were as follows: weight, 4.5 kg; body temperature, 98.1°F; pulse, 132 beats/min; respiration, 40 breaths/min; blood pressure, not recorded; and pulse oximetry, 100% saturation on room air. His examination was remarkable only for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur without radiation and an elliptical-shaped right pupil. His right pupil was cloudy and nonreactive and demonstrated a white reflex. His extraocular muscles appeared intact with no signs of eyelid edema, scleral injection, discharge, proptosis, hyphema, or hypopyon (see Fig. 1). No corneal abrasion was found by fluorescence staining. The left pupil was unremarkable. The patient was transferred to a pediatric tertiary care center for an ophthalmologic examination for suspected retinoblastoma and to rule out retinal detachment and endophthalmitis. Retinoblastoma is a rare eye tumor of childhood that arises in the retina and represents approximately 4% of all pediatric malignancies [3]. It is estimated that 250 to 300 new cases are diagnosed in the United States and 5000 worldwide each year, with no racial or sex predilection [4]. Retinoblastomas can be classified in 3 ways: sporadic (60%) or hereditary (40%), unilateral (60%) or bilateral (40%), or the result of a somatic (inactivation in a single developing retinal progenitor cell; 66% of cases) or germline mutation (mutation that is present in all cells of the body; 33% of cases) [4-6]. Hereditary retinoblastoma constitutes a cancer predisposition syndrome. Patients with germline mutations have a greater than 90% risk of developing a retinoblastoma and are at increased risk of developing other types of cancers, including osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, primary intracranial neuroblastic tumors (ie, ""trilateral retinoblastoma,"" the most commonly diagnosed form, typically within the first few years after an initial retinoblastoma diagnosis), and cutaneous melanomas [5,7,8]. In general, the risk of developing a secondary neoplasm in patients with germline mutations is 10% at 10 years, 20% at 20 years, and 30% at 30 years of follow-up, with 50% developing a second nonocular malignant neoplasm by 50 years of age [7,9]. Retinoblastoma was one of the prototypic models demonstrating the genetic etiology of cancer. It was once thought that inactivation of both RB1 tumor suppressor gene copies, by either mutation or deletion error on chromosome 13q14, resulted in the development of a retinoblastoma (the so-called 2-hit theory). However, it has been argued in recent years that this model may be too simplistic because it does not take into account the role of aneuploidy and chromosome instability [1]. It is important for the emergency physician to recognize the presenting signs of retinoblastoma because survival is highly dependent on the degree of tumor extension at the time of initial diagnosis [2]. In any patient where the diagnosis of retinoblastoma is being entertained, it is important to obtain any family history of retinoblastoma, eye tumors, enucleations, or other childhood malignancies. The median age at diagnosis is 12 months in those with bilateral tumors and 24 months in those with unilateral disease [10]. The presenting clinical manifestations will vary with disease stage; however, leukocoria (white pupillary reflex, ""cat's eye reflex,"" most often seen with large tumors) and strabismus (eyes not properly aligned, cross-eyes) are the most common ocular physical findings [4,5]. The family might bring a child to the ED and report the appearance of a ""cat's eye,"" ""twinkle,"" or ""sparkle"" appreciated after the examination of a flash photograph [2]. Patients with retinoblastoma can also present with a red painful eye, tearing, poor vision, orbital cellulites, a dilated or irregular pupil, failure to thrive, corneal clouding, discoloration of the iris (heterochromia caused by neovascularization, ie, rubeosis), atraumatic hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, hypopyon, pseudouveitis, eye enlargement (buphthalmia), proptosis, or glaucoma [2,4,5,11-14]. Neovascular glaucoma occurs in 17% of patients and usually occurs in eyes with advanced tumor and retinal detachment [15]. Patients with bilateral or familial retinoblastoma can develop a brain tumor (8%) (pinealoblastoma) in the parasellar or pineal gland region, known as ""trilateral retinoblastoma"" [16,17]. These patients may present with headache, vomiting, hydrocephalus, or meningismus [18]. The classic fundus findings include solitary or multiple yellow-white retinal tumors with prominent retinal feeder vessels. Overlying vitreous hemorrhage is occasionally seen in advanced cases but may be difficult for the emergency physician to appreciate with a direct ophthalmoscope in a patient with an undilated pupil [7]. Advanced retinoblastoma can present as aggressive extraocular infiltration via the optic nerve, with direct extension of the invading orbital tumor through the subarachnoid space. Once in the choroid plexus, it can metastasize hematogenously to the brain, bone, liver, kidney, lung, testes, and lymph nodes. The differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma includes retinopathy of prematurity, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (persistent fetal vasculature), coats disease, toxocariasis, congenital cataract, retinal astrocytoma, retinochoroidal coloboma, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, uveitis, retinal detachments, and medulloepitheliomas. Interestingly, ""Despite the classic appearance of retinoblastoma, nearly 50% of patients diagnosed initially with possible retinoblastoma prove, on referral to ocular oncologists, to have simulating conditions and not retinoblastoma"" [7]. Recognition of an abnormality involving the patient's eye and prompt referral to an ophthalmologist are the key components in the ED management of a suspected retinoblastoma. Ancillary testing is not indicated in the emergency setting. It is imperative that adequate follow-up be arranged for patients suspected of having a retinoblastoma before they leave the ED. If prompt follow-up with an ophthalmologist cannot be arranged or the treating physician is concerned with the family's ability to comply with scheduled follow-up, it is necessary to transfer the patient to a tertiary care center for evaluation. After referral to an ophthalmologist, the patient will undergo complete examination including indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus photography. Ophthalmic ultrasound will also be performed, which may show characteristic intralesional hyperechoic areas with associated shadowing, consistent with areas of calcification. False-positive results are not uncommon using this imaging modality. Computed tomography (CT) scans are no longer routinely used in patients with a suspected retinoblastoma, secondary to the increased risk of cancer in children who have had CT scans. Although the calcifications in the tumor, which are a key feature of retinoblastomas, are more easily identified in CT scan, the trend is toward using magnetic resonance imaging to decrease radiation exposure. Of note, needle biopsies are rarely performed in patients with a suspected retinoblastoma because of the risk of tumor seeding and orbital invasion [6].",,"article; case report; enucleation; human; infant; laser; leukokoria; male; priority journal; pupil; retinoblastoma",,,,,,,"Mastrangelo, D., De Francesco, S., Di Leonardo, A., Lentini, L., Hadjistilianou, T., Does the evidence matter in medicine?

The suite includes advanced services for ontology change, comparison and versioning over a common knowledge repository offering persistent storage and validation. © 2009, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,"Bechhofer, S., Horrocks, I., Goble, C., Stevens, R., Oiled: A reason-able ontology editor for the semantic web (2001) Proceedings of the Joint German/Austrian Conference: Advances in Artificial Intelligence, , (KI-01); Benn, N., Shum, B.S., Domingue, J., Integrating scholarly argumentation, texts and community: Towards an ontology and services (2005) Tech Report KMI-05-5, , http://kmi.open.ac.uk/publications/pdf/kmi-05-5.pdf; Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The semantic web: A new form of web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities (2001) Scientific American, p. 17. , May; Braun, S., Schmidt, A., Walter, A., Zacharias, V., The ontology maturing approach for collaborative and work integrated ontology development: Evaluation results and future directions (2007) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Emergent Semantics and Ontology Evolution, , 12 Nov. 2007, Bexco, Busan Korea; de Leenheer, P., Meersman, R., Towards community-based evolution of knowledge-intensive systems (2007) Proceedings of Ontologies, Databases, and Applications of Semantics, , In; Ding, Y., Fensel, D., Ontology library systems: The key to successful ontology re-use (2001) Proceedings of the 1st International Semantic Web Working Symposium (SWWS'01), , In; Domingue, J., Motta, E., Shum, S.B., Vargas-Vera, M., Kalfoglou, Y., Farnes, N., Supporting ontology driven document enrichment within communities of practice (2001) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP-01), pp. 30-37. , In, New York, USA: ACM Press; Flouris, G., On the evolution of ontological signatures (2007) Proceedings of the Workshop on Ontology Evolution (OnE-07; Flouris, G., Manakanatas, D., Kondylakis, H., Plexousakis, D., Antoniou, G., Ontology change: Classification and survey (2008) Knowledge Engineering Review (KER), , to appear; Gabel, T., Sure, Y., Voelker, J., Kaonontology management infrastructure (2004) SEKT Informal Deliverable, 3 (1); Gärdenfors, P., Belief revision: An introduction (1992) Belief Revision, pp. 1-20. , In Gärdenfors, P.

Since then, it is continuously providing high resolution space-borne radar data which are perfectly suitable for sophisticated interferometric applications. I.e. the mission concept and the SAR sensor support the coherent stacking of radar scenes which is the basis for advanced processing techniques e.g. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and SAR tomography. In particular, the short repeat cycle of eleven days and the highly reproducible scene repetition of the spotlight acquisitions support the stacking and consequently the time series analysis of the radar data. Furthermore, the sensor's orbital tube is precisely controlled to be in the order of 200 m which basically allows to utilize the baseline spread of the stacked acquisitions. However, this small spread is actually limiting the resolution in the SAR tomography. Interferometric applications could be demonstrated already in a very early stage of the TerraSAR-X mission. Because the resolution is 0.6 m in slant range and 1.1 m in azimuth in the high resolution spotlight mode the PSI and the SAR tomography processing results were impressive. Urban areas and single buildings could be mapped from space in three dimensions. Even the structural stress of single buildings caused by thermal dilation could be demonstrated. However, extended layover areas are caused by typical buildings and as a consequence complicated scattering situations need to be resolved. DLR's operational In-SAR processing system GENESIS had already been adapted to cope with the new sensor modes of TerraSAR-X and their new specific spectral characteristics. Now, the new image characteristics e.g. the extended layover areas and the long time coherent distributed scatterer need better to be supported. Subject is to optimally exploit the available information e.g. the radar reflectivity. Several algorithms of the processing system can take advantage of this, e.g. the scatterer configuration detection. As a matter of fact, the scatterer configuration has now become a very important characteristic for each resolution cell. It influences e.g. the estimation data extraction, the estimation of the 3D location and basically the estimation precision. A typical resolution cell can be composed of a single dominant point scatterer surrounded by clutter, two or more dominant point scatterers in clutter and of distributed scatterers with a specific phase stability over time. The paper provides technical details and a processing example of a newly developed algorithm to retrieve the 3D location of point scatterers from the scene's intensity which finally also provides the information on the scatterer configuration in a resolution cell. ©2009 IEEE.","Persistent scatterer interferometry; SAR radargrammetry; SAR tomography; TerraSAR-X","Persistent scatterer interferometry; Persistent scatterers; Radargrammetry; SAR tomography; TerraSAR-X; Beam plasma interactions; Bioinformatics; Clutter (information theory); Estimation; Geology; Image reconstruction; Interferometry; Phase stability; Radar; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space optics; Synthetic aperture radar; Three dimensional; Time series; Time series analysis; Tomography; Coherent scattering",,,,,,,"Fornaro, G., Monti Guarnieri, C., Pauciullo, A., Tebaldini, S., Joint multi-baseline SAR interferometry (2005) EURASIP J.

By the nineteenth century, indigenous peoples assumed a privileged position as subjects of scientific study, but as peoples undergoing or having undergone biological and cultural decline, if not disappearance, especially in Cuba, where indigenous Taíno were (are) considered long extinct. This diminution was facilitated by anthropological paradigms, historiography, and the ideology of race. Though indigenous studies have recently advanced toward a richer, more complex and nuanced understanding of these issues, necessarily facilitated by indigenous participants, holdovers from the old theories of blood quantum and cultural essentialism endure. Paradoxically, however, representations of indigenous peoples based in these persistent paradigms, however obsolete, provide important evidence for the persistence of indigenous peoples and communities in places like Cuba.

The results from a sequence of 170 numerical simulations are summarized. The sequence covers a two-dimensional parameter space, with the first parameter defining the hollowness of the vortex (i.e., the ratio of eye to inner-core relative vorticity) and the second parameter defining the thickness of the ring (i.e., the ratio of the inner and outer radii of the ring). In approximately one-half of the cases, the ring becomes barotropically unstable, and there ensues a vigorous vorticity mixing episode between the eye and eyewall. The output of the barotropic model is used to (i) verify that the nonlinear model approximately replicates the linear theory of the fastest-growing azimuthal mode in the early phase of the evolution, and (ii) characterize the end states (defined at t = 48 h) that result from the nonlinear chaotic vorticity advection and mixing. It is found that the linear stability theory is a good guide to the fastest-growing exponential mode in the numerical model. Two additional features are observed in the numerical model results. The first is an azimuthal wavenumber-2 deformation of the vorticity ring that occurs for moderately thick, nearly filled rings. The second is an algebraically growing wavenumber-1 instability (not present in the linear theory because of the assumed solution) that is observed as a wobbling eye (or the trochoidal oscillation for a moving vortex) for thick rings that are stable to all exponentially growing instabilities. Most end states are found to be monopoles. For very hollow and thin rings, persistent mesovortices may exist for more than 15 h before merging to a monopole. For thicker rings, the relaxation to a monopole takes longer (between 48 and 72 h). For moderately thick rings with nearly filled cores, the most likely end state is an elliptical eyewall. In this nondivergent barotropic context, both the minimum central pressure and maximum tangential velocity simultaneously decrease over 48 h during all vorticity mixing events. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Azimuthal modes; Barotropic; Barotropic models; Exponential modes; Eyewall; Inner core; Linear stability theory; Linear theory; Moderately thick; Non-linear model; Numerical models; Numerical simulation; Potential vorticity; Relative vorticity; Tangential velocities; Vorticity advection; Wave numbers; Computer simulation; Convergence of numerical methods; Hurricanes; Mixing; Vorticity; Mathematical models; barotropic instability; barotropic motion; hurricane; numerical model; vorticity",,,,,,,"Corbosiero, K.L., Molinari, J., Aiyyer, A.R., Black, M.L., The structure and evolution of Hurricane Elena (1985).

Design/methodology/approach Papers that judiciously review the development and application of patient satisfaction were identified; along with studies addressing the conceptual and methodological deficiencies associated with the concept; and the current perceived service quality theory. Findings Patient satisfaction has been extensively studied and considerable effort has gone into developing survey instruments to measure it. However, most reviews have been critical of its use, since there is rarely any theoretical or conceptual development of the patient satisfaction concept. The construct has little standardisation, low reliability and uncertain validity. It continues to be used interchangeably with, and as a proxy for, perceived service quality, which is a conceptually different and superior construct. Practical implications The persistent use of patient satisfaction to evaluate the client's perception of the quality of a health service is seriously flawed. The key to solving this dilemma may be for the healthcare sector to focus on perceived health service quality by considering the specific concepts and models that can be found in the services marketing literature. This literature offers more advanced consumer theories which are better differentiated and tested than existing healthcare satisfaction models. Originality/value The paper points out that there is an urgent need for differentiation and standardisation of satisfaction and service quality definitions and constructs, and argues for research to focus on measuring perceived health service quality. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Customer satisfaction; Health services; Patients; Quality management",,,,,,,,"Bell, L., Developing service quality in mental health services (2004) International Journal of Health Care Quality Assurance, 17 (7), pp. 401-406; Boyer, L., François, P., Doutre, E., Weil, G., Labarere, J., Perception and use of the results of patient satisfaction surveys by care providers in a French teaching hospital (2006) International Journal for Quality in Health Care, 18 (5), pp. 359-364; Brady, M.K., Cronin, J.J.J., Some new thoughts on conceptualizing perceived service quality: a hierarchical approach (2001) Journal of Marketing, 65 (3), pp. 34-49; Brown, C., Where are the patients in the quality of health care?

The deadliest accident in the history of commercial aviation occurred at Tenerife Airport in the Canary Islands. As commercial airliners become larger and airports more congested the potential for major accidents on the airport surface is expected to increase. Runway Status Lights (RWSL) have shown promise in precluding this potentiality through demonstrated operational suitability and measured reductions in runway incursions as cited independently in an audit by the US Inspector General. RWSL will be deployed to 22 airports in the near future. MIT Lincoln Laboratory has recently completed human factors assessments in support of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) ongoing operational evaluations of RWSL at Dallas/Ft. Worth International Airport (DFW) and RWSL at San Diego International Airport (SAN). The evaluations of RWSL at DFW and SAN began in 2004 and 2006, respectively. In addition, we have been assessing preliminary data from an ongoing operational evaluation of the Final Approach Runway Occupancy Signal (FAROS) at DFW that began four months ago. The assessments were developed to evaluate the effectiveness and operational suitability of RWSL and FAROS in reducing runway incursions and preventing accidents. The human factors assessments conducted to measure and record RWSL and FAROS operational suitability are presented here (with the FAROS data subject to change as the ongoing operational evaluation continues). The process established to include human factors research, development, and testing is specifically described.","Final approach runway occupancy signal; Human factors; Runway status lights","Accidents; Advanced traffic management systems; Air traffic control; Aircraft accidents; Automata theory; Civil aviation; Human engineering; Research and development management; Commercial airliner; Federal Aviation Administration; Final approach; Human factors research; Inspector generals; International airport; National airspace system; Operational evaluation; Airports",,,,,,,"Performance Review Commission, (2003) A Comparison of Performance in Selected US and European En-route Centres, , http://www.eurocontrol.int/prc, May; (2007) ICAO Manual on Air Navigation Services Economics, , Document 9161 Fourth Edition; Howell, D., Bennett, M., Bonn, J., Knorr, D., Paper 23 estimating the en route efficiency benefits pool (2003) 5th USA-Europe ATM Seminar, Budapest Hungary, , June; Performance Review Comission, Performance Review Report 2007, pp. 61-63. , http://www.eurocontrol.int/prc",,,"","EUROCONTROL","8th USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar, ATM 2009","29 June 2009 through 2 July 2009",,113760,,9781510801714,,,"English","Proc.

These numerical simulations based on mathematical equations in conservation form predict that the ITER international tokamak project will encounter persistent disruptions and edge localized mode (ELMS) crashes. Test particle runs of the TRAN transport code suggest that for quasineutrality to prevail in tokamaks a certain minimum level of 3D asymmetry of the magnetic spectrum is required which is comparable to that found in quasiaxially symmetric (QAS) stellarators. The computational theory suggests that a QAS stellarator with two field periods and proportions like those of ITER is a good candidate for a fusion reactor. For a demonstration reactor (DEMO) we seek an experiment that combines the best features of ITER, with a system of QAS coils providing external rotational transform, which is a measure of the poloidal field. We have discovered a configuration with unusually good quasisymmetry that is ideal for this task.","Computational science; Magnetic fusion; Plasma physics","Computation theory; Fusion reactors; Magnetohydrodynamics; Magnetoplasma; Nuclear reactors; Plasma devices; Plasma theory; Computational science; Computational theories; Demonstration reactor; Magnetic fusion; Mathematical equations; Non-linear stabilities; Plasma physics; Rotational transform; Tokamak devices",,,,,,,"Alexander, R., Garabedian, P., Choice of coils for a fusion reactor (2007) Proc.

Adaptive control techniques are well suited to nonlinear applications, such as wind turbines, which are difficult to accurately model and which have effects from poorly known operating environments. In this paper, we extended the direct model reference adaptive control (DMRAC) approach to track a reference point and to reject persistent disturbances. This approach was then used to design an adaptive collective pitch controller for a high-fidelity simulation of a variable-speed horizontal axis wind turbine. The objective of the adaptive pitch controller was to regulate generator speed in Region 3 and to reject step disturbances. The control objective was accomplished by collectively pitching the turbine blades. The turbine simulation models the controls advanced research turbine (CART) of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. The CART is a utility-scale wind turbine that has a well-developed and extensively verified simulator. This novel application of adaptive control was compared in simulations with a classical proportional integrator (PI) collective pitch controller. In the simulations, the adaptive pitch controller showed improved speed regulation in Region 3 when compared with the PI pitch controller.

Reaching such a goal requires the high-level integration of both science and technology aspects of magnetic fusion into self-consistent plasma regimes in fusion-grade devices. On the physics side, the first constraint addresses the magnetic confinement itself which must be made persistent. This means to either rely on intrinsically steady-state configurations, like the stellarator one, or turn the inductively driven tokamak configuration into a fully non-inductive one, through a mix of additional current sources. The low efficiency of the external current drive methods and the necessity to minimize the re-circulating power claim for a current mix strongly weighted by the internal 'pressure driven' bootstrap current, itself strongly sensitive to the heat and particle transport properties of the plasma. A virtuous circle may form as the heat and particle transport properties are themselves sensitive to the current profile conditions. Note that several other factors, e.g. plasma rotation profile, magneto-hydro-dynamics activity, also influence the equilibrium state. In the present tokamak devices, several examples of such 'advanced tokamak' physics research demonstrate the feasibility of steady-state regimes, though with a number of open questions still under investigation. The modelling activity also progresses quite fast in this domain and supports understanding and extrapolation. This high level of physics sophistication of the plasma scenario however needs to be combined with steady-state technological constraints. The technology constraints for steady-state operation are basically twofold: the specific technologies required to reach the steady-state plasma conditions and the generic technologies linked to the long pulse operation of a fusion device. The first includes specific additional heating and current drive methods (through externally launched radio-frequency waves or energetic atoms), fuelling and pumping methods, dedicated plasma diagnostics as well as software technologies required for mandatory real time control loops, involving such actuators and sensors. The second class of technologies, generic to any magnetic fusion device, includes the superconducting magnet technologies, in order to provide a stationary confinement magnetic field, the actively cooled plasma facing components (PFCs) handling either radiated or convected power fluxes (often in excess of several tens of MW m-2), dedicated diagnostics monitoring the interfaces (e.g. infrared survey of PFCs), etc. The detailed specifications of all elements must comply with a reactor-relevant environment, in terms of operational parameters as well as lifetime. The paper presents a summary of the present status and understanding of the technology and science of steady-state operation in magnetically confined plasmas, as well as the forthcoming work programme dedicated to the vast R&amp;D programme undertaken in this domain, in particular within the European fusion framework. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Actuators and sensors; Additional heating; Advanced tokamak; Bootstrap current; Circulating power; Cooled plasmas; Current drives; Current profile; Current sources; Equilibrium state; External currents; Fusion devices; Generic technology; Grand Challenge; Long pulse operation; Magnetic confinement; Magnetic fusion; Magnetic fusion devices; Magnetically confined fusion plasmas; Magnetically confined plasmas; New sources; Operational parameters; Physics research; Plasma regimes; Plasma rotations; Plasma scenario; Power flux; Present status; Pressure-driven; Radiofrequency waves; Research and development; Science and Technology; Software technology; Steady-state operation; Steady-state plasmas; Steady-state regime; Technological constraints; Technology constraints; Approximation theory; Fusion reactor divertors; Magnetic domains; Magnetic fields; Particle separators; Plasma confinement; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma theory; Real time control; Superconducting magnets; Tokamak devices; Transport properties; Technology",,,,,,,"Braams, M., Stott, P., (2002) Nuclear Fusion, Half A Century of Magnetic Confinement Fusion Research; Keilhacker, M., Al, E., (1999) Nucl.

In general, it is characterized by flushing, persistent erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasies. According to the National Rosacea Society, subtypes include erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, ocular, phymatous, and variant, granulomatous. The pathogenesis is not entirely understood, but theories focus on a variety of vascular, microbial, and connective tissue etiologies. Triggers that induce or exacerbate rosacea should be avoided as the first step in treatment. Therapeutic options include topical agents, oral therapy, and laser and light therapy. Surgery is needed in cases of advanced rhinophyma. Light based treatments are of particularly useful for the telangiectatic aspects of rosacea. Topical agents are preferred for long-term management of rosacea, however, oral therapy may be needed for short-term for relief of moderate to severe flushing and erythema.","Demodex; Flushing; Papulopustiular; Rhinophyma; Rosacea",,,,,,,,"Society NR.

A line of research has tested the core propositions from her theory regarding the causes of life-course persistent offenders and the causes of adolescence-limited offenders, but very little research has investigated whether Moffitt's explanation of delinquency abstention is supported empirically. Aim: To examine the biosocial correlates of delinquency abstention. Method: We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the effects of two dopamine receptor genes (the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) and the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4)), drug-using peers, neighbourhood problems, low self-control, public assistance, age, race, and gender on delinquency abstention. The statistical models were calculated by employing binary logistic regression. Results: Analysis of the Add Health data revealed that exposure to drug-using peers and levels of self-control were associated with abstention from delinquency. In addition, there was some evidence suggesting that DRD2 and DRD4 had protective effects against delinquent involvement for males. Conclusion: A multifactorial arrangement of environmental and genetic factors contributes to delinquency abstention.

A project was carried out in which high quality 3D visualizations using high-resolution CT and MR images from clinical research were developed for educational use. Instead of standard stacks of slices (original or multiplanar reformatted) volume-rendering images in the quicktime VR format that enables students to interact intuitively were included. Based on learning theories underpinning problem based learning, 3D visualizations were implemented in the existing curricula of the medical and physiotherapy programs. The images/films were used in lectures, demonstrations and tutorial sessions. Self-study material was also developed. Aims: To support learning efficacy by developing and using 3D datasets in regular health care curricula and enhancing the knowledge about possible educational value of 3D visualizations in learning anatomy and physiology. Method: Questionnaires were used to investigate the medical and physiotherapy students' opinions about the different formats of visualizations and their learning experiences. Results: The 3D images/films stimulated the students will to understand more and helped them to get insights about biological variations and different organs size, space extent and relation to each other. The virtual dissections gave a clearer picture than ordinary dissections and the possibility to turn structures around was instructive. Conclusions: 3D visualizations based on authentic, viable material point out a new dimension of learning material in anatomy, physiology and probably also pathophysiology. It was successful to implement 3D images in already existing themes in the educational programs. The results show that deeper knowledge is required about students' interpretation of images/films in relation to learning outcomes. There is also a need for preparations and facilitation principles connected to the use of 3D visualizations.",,"article; computer assisted tomography; curriculum; education program; educational technology; fluoroscopy; functional anatomy; heart; knee function; lung; medical education; medical student; physical therapy student; physiology; problem based learning; virtual reality; Anatomy; Education, Medical; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Learning; Physiology; Questionnaires; Students, Medical",,,"QuickTime VR",,,,"Calhoun, P.S., Kuszyk, B.S., Three-dimensional volume rendering of spiral CT data: Theory and method (1999) Radiographics, 19 (3), pp. 745-764; Cottam, W.W., Adequacy of medical school gross anatomy education as perceived by certain postgraduate residency programmes and anatomy course directors (1999) Clin Anat, 12 (1), pp. 55-65; Dev, P., Montgomery, K., Senger, S., Leroy Heinrichs, W., Srivastava, S., Waldron, K., Simulated medical learning environments on the Internet (2002) J Am Med Informatics Assoc, 9 (5), pp. 437-447; Drebin, R.A., Carpenter, L., Volume rendering (1988) Comput Graph, 22 (4), pp. 65-74; Friedl, R., Preisack, M.B., Klas, W., Rose, T., Stracke, S., Quast, K.J., Virtual reality and 3D visualizations in heart surgery education (2002) Heart Surg Forum, 5 (3), pp. 17-21; Fyrenius, A., Bergdahl, B., Silen, C., Lectures in problem-based learning-why, when and how?

Coming to grips with the complexity and fluidity of organization and management is a persistent problem for scholars and practitioners alike, which is why process issues have received renewed interest in recent years. This book, aimed at scholars and higher level students, frames some of these issues in novel and instructive ways. Process views have existed since before the early Greek philosophers and have made decisive marks in all sciences. Alfred North Whitehead's classic work is a landmark in process philosophy, and his thinking provides renewed impetus to social scientists in search of an expanded framework of process thinking. Theorists such as Niklas Luhmann, Bruno Latour, Karl Weick and James March have contributed significantly towards a process view of organization. In this book, central aspects of their thinking are interpreted and discussed with the help of a broader canvas of process thinking provided by Whitehead. The comparisons do not only allow for interesting connections to be made between the theorists, but they also enable understanding to be made of the thinking behind their respective works. From the analysis, ideas are suggested for a framework for process-based organizational analysis. Advanced students and academics in sociology, organization studies and management studies will find this book useful in its discussion of such subjects as organization theory, process philosophy and process studies. © 2008 Tor Hernes.

Theory and methods: Physically federated integration is used for design of the underlying technical architecture to implement a mobile virtual health record for integrated home care. A user centered system development approach is followed during design and development of the system. Results: A technical platform based on a service-oriented approach where database functionality and services are separated has been developed. This guarantees flexibility with regard to changed functional demands and allows third party systems to interact with the platform in a standardized way. A physically federated integration enables point-of-care documentation, integrated presentation of information from different feeder systems, and offline access to data on handheld devices. Feeder systems deliver information in XML-files that are mapped against an ideal XML schema, published as an interface for integration with the information broker, and inserted into the mediator database. Conclusions: A seamless flow of information between both different care professionals involved in integrated home care and patients and relatives is provided through mobile information access and interaction with different feeder systems using the virtual health record. © 2007, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

Some suggest that the ""roll out"" of new forms of state activity are occurring. This paper argues that perceptions of ""roll back"" and ""roll out"" arise from a particular conception of the capacity of the state that focuses on apparent state action over discursive production. A modified version of governmentality theory is deployed to demonstrate that despite perceptions of a weakening state housing assistance presence in Australia, the UK, the Netherlands and New Zealand, the conceptive and discursive role of the state has remained strong. The paper concludes by arguing that greater appreciation of the persistent pragmatic capacity of the state to define the objects, subjects and relationships of housing policy fruitfully illuminates the condition of the state under neoliberalism.","Government; Housing assistance; Neoliberalism; Policy; The state","housing policy; neoliberalism; policy reform; social housing; state role; Australasia; Australia; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; New Zealand; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,,"The Contract State: Public Management and the Kennett Government, , Alford, J. and O'Neill, D., (Eds).

In the first part of my paper I try to remedy this situation by offering what I consider a clear and faithful explication of becoming, valid independently of the particular spacetime setting in which we operate. Along the way, I will show why the metaphysical debate between the so-called ""presentists"" and ""eternalists"" is completely irrelevant to the question of becoming, as the debate itself is generated by a failure to distinguish between a tensed and a tenseless sense of ""existence"". After a much needed distinction between absolute and relational becoming, I then show in what sense classical (non-quantum) spacetime physics presupposes both types of becoming, for the simple reason that spacetime physics presupposes an ontology of (timelike-separated) events. As a consequence, not only does it turn out that using physics to try to provide empirical evidence for the existence of becoming amounts to putting the cart before the horses, but also that the order imposed by ""the arrow of becoming"" is more fundamental than any other physical arrow of time, despite the fact that becoming cannot be used to explain why entropy grows, or retarded electromagnetic radiation prevails versus advanced radiation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a theory of media bias that originates with private information obtained by journalists through their investigations and persists despite profit-maximizing news organizations and rivalry from other news organizations. Bias has two effects on the demand for news. First, rational individuals are more skeptical of potentially biased news and thus rely less on it in their decision-making. This skepticism reduces demand and leads the news organization to set a lower price for its publication the greater is the bias it tolerates. Lower quality news thus commands a lower price. Second, bias makes certain stories more likely than others. Given their private information, journalists may bias their stories if their career prospects can be advanced by being published on the front page. News organizations can control bias by restricting the discretion allowed to journalists, but granting discretion and tolerating bias can increase profits if it allows journalists to be hired at a lower wage. Bias is not driven from the market by a rival news organization nor by a news organization with an opposing bias, and the profits of a high-bias news organization can be higher than the profits of a low bias one. Moreover, bias can be greater with competition than with a monopoly news organization. If individuals collectively choose regulation in place of their individual decision-making, bias increases the expected stringency of regulation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

By reading social contract theory alongside representations of the domestic sphere by authors such as Mary Astell, Mary Davys, Samuel Richardson, Eliza Haywood, and Frances Sheridan, Thompson shows how these writers confront women's paradoxical status as both contractual agents and naturally subject wives. Over the long eighteenth century, Thompson argues, domestic novelists appropriated the standard of political modernity advanced by John Locke and others as a citizen's free or ""ingenuous"" assent to the law. The domestic novel figures feminine political difference not as women's deviation from an abstract universal but rather as their failure freely or ingenuously to submit to the power retained by Enlightenment husbands. Ingenuous Subjection claims domestic novelists as vital participants in Enlightenment political discourse. By tracing the political, philosophical, and generic significance of feminine compliance, this book revises our literary historical account of the rise of the novel. Rather than imagining a realm of harmonious sentiment, domestic fiction represents the persistent arbitrariness of eighteenth-century men's conjugal power. Ingenuous Subjection revises feminist theory and historiography, locating the genealogy of feminism in a contractual model of ingenuous assent which challenges the legitimacy of masculine conjugal government. The first study to treat feminine compliance as something other than a passive, politically neutral exercise, Ingenuous Subjection recovers in this practice the domestic novel's critical engagement with the limits of Enlightenment modernity.

But few researchers have made empirical studies about the lived phenomenon. Several researchers within nursing agree that more research concerning individual groups of patients has to be initiated. Within research about patients with incurable cancer focus has been on death, the terminal period and patients experience of being dying. This qualitative study was initiated to describe the characteristics of a group of Danish hospitalized patients' experienced suffering in life with incurable cancer. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were arranged with 12 patients ones a week within a period of 4 weeks. In week 2 and 4, the interviews were supplemented by questions developed on the basis of the potential signs of suffering which appeared during the participant observations that took place the day before each interview. C. S. Peirce's semiotic and phenomenological grounded theory of signs was used in order to identify the potential signs. A phenomenological methodology developed by A. Giorgi was used to develop and describe the general structure of the phenomenon. The phenomenon is described as: 'The experience of living in an increasingly unpredictable existents at the mercy of the body, the consciousness, the illness, the death, the treatment, the professionals, one's articulateness, the past, the present and the future, influenced by increasing powerlessness, loneliness and isolation, and the experience of existing in an persistent, and with time, unconquerable struggle to maintain and regain control'. © 2005 Nordic College of Caring Sciences.","Descriptive theory; Incurable cancer; Lived experience; Palliative care; Phenomenological research; Suffering","adult; advanced cancer; aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; data analysis; experience; female; hospitalization; human; interview; male; palliative therapy; patient attitude; social isolation; terminally ill patient; adaptive behavior; age; attitude to death; attitude to health; behavior; control; Denmark; existentialism; hospital patient; loneliness; mental stress; middle aged; neoplasm; nursing methodology research; psychological aspect; psychological model; qualitative research; questionnaire; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Attitude to Death; Attitude to Health; Denmark; Existentialism; Female; Humans; Inpatients; Internal-External Control; Loneliness; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Neoplasms; Nursing Methodology Research; Power (Psychology); Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Social Isolation; Stress, Psychological; Terminally Ill",,,,,,,"Qvarnström, U., (1993) Varing;r Død, , Almqvist og Wiksell, Sweden; Qvarnström, U., (1982) På Dødsleiet, Tanker Og Opplevelser Ved Livets Slutt, , Tiden Norsk Forlag, Larvik; Feigenberg, L., (1976) Om Døden: Dødens Psykologi Og Menneskelig Pleje Af Døende, , Reitzel, København; Kübler-Ross, E., (1969) On Death and Dying, , MacMillan, New York; Glaser, B.G., Strauss, A.L., (1968) Time for Dying, , Adline Publishing Company, Chicago; Glaser, B.G., Strauss, A.L., (1965) Awareness of Dying, , Adline Publishing Company, Chicago; Hald, M., (1993) Døende Kræftpatienter Påhospitalet, , Kræftens bekæmpelse, Århus; Morrison, P., (1994) Understanding Patients, , Ballière Tindal, London; Eriksen, T.R., (1995) Omsorg i Forandring., pp. 308-317. , Munksgaard, Copenhagen; Jensen, S.S., Nielsen, H., Samuelsen, H., Steffen, V., (1987) Hvad er Meningen Med Kræft?

Yet empirical research has had limited success in uncovering this relationship. This paper reexamines the issue in light of broader data and a new modeling approach that incorporates two key features of the theory. Unlike previous studies, we model inflation as non-linearly related to fiscal deficits through the inflation tax base and estimate this relationship as intrinsically dynamic, using panel techniques that explicitly distinguish between short- and long-run effects of fiscal deficits.

Although delay seems to be inevitable and linked to resource limitations, it often is neither. Rather, it is usually the result of unplanned, irrational scheduling and resource allocation. Application of queuing theory and principles of industrial engineering, adapted appropriately to clinical settings, can reduce delay substantially, even in small practices, without requiring additional resources. One model, sometimes referred to as advanced access, has increasingly been shown to reduce waiting times in primary care. The core principle of advanced access is that patients calling to schedule a physician visit are offered an appointment the same day. Advanced access is not sustainable if patient demand for appointments is permanently greater than physician capacity to offer appointments. Six elements of advanced access are important in its application: balancing supply and demand, reducing backlog, reducing the variety of appointment types, developing contingency plans for unusual circumstances, working to adjust demand profiles, and increasing the availability of bottleneck resources. Although these principles are powerful, they are counter to deeply held beliefs and established practices in health care organizations. Adopting these principles requires strong leadership investment and support.",,"clinical feature; engineering; health care access; health care organization; health care planning; hospital admission; industrial medicine; investment; leadership; primary medical care; priority journal; process model; process optimization; resource allocation; review; article; health care delivery; health service; hospital admission; hospital management; human; nonbiological model; organization and management; primary health care; time management; total quality management; United States; Appointments and Schedules; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Models, Organizational; Primary Health Care; Resource Allocation; Time Management; Total Quality Management; United States; Waiting Lists",,,,,,,"Nolan, T.W., Schall, M.W., Berwick, D.M., Roessner, J., (1996) Reducing Delays and Waiting Times Throughout the Healthcare System, , Boston, Mass: Institute for Healthcare Improvement; Goitein, M., Waiting patiently (1990) N Engl J Med, 323, pp. 604-608; Waiting patiently (1991) N Engl J Med, 324, pp. 335-337; (2000) National Survey of Consumer Experiences with Health Plans, , Menlo Park, Calif: Kaiser Family Foundation; June; Cunningham, P.J., Clancy, C.M., Cohen, J.W., Wilets, M., The use of hospital emergency departments for nonurgent health problems: A national perspective (1995) Med Care Res Rev, 52, pp. 453-474; Strunk, B.C., Cunningham, P.J., (2002) Treading Water: Americans' Access to Needed Medical Care, 1997-2001, , Washington, DC: Center for Studying Health System Change; March; Greenblatt, J., (2002) Access to Urgent Medical Care, 2001, , Rockville, Md: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

The variability of water vapor is examined using contemporaneous potential vorticity fields to separate the vortex from the extravortex air. The overall water vapor distribution from the ILAS measurements agrees qualitatively with the water vapor climatology in the UARS reference atmosphere (covering 1992-1999), and the space-time variability is consistent with the known stratospheric circulation. Quantitatively, comparisons between ILAS and Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) equivalent latitude zonal means show agreement to within 5% in the lower stratosphere (400-800 K potential temperature or 15-30 km). In the upper stratosphere (800-1800 K potential temperature or 30-45 km), however, ILAS data have a 10% to 20% high bias compared to the 8-year (1992-1999) UARS climatology and to HALOE data for the same time period. The ILAS data, covering the time period November 1996 to June 1997, were measured during a winter-spring period when the Arctic polar stratosphere was anomalously cold. The ILAS water vapor data suggest an Arctic vortex that is more isolated and persistent in the spring than that seen in the UARS climatology. The spatial and temporal extent of the Arctic vortex this year was very similar to that of the Antarctic vortex. This feature is supported by HALOE data for the same measurement period. Using a trajectory model, we show that the NH vortex in spring 1997 was significantly more isolated compared to other years in the decade, and this explains the unusual confinement of high water vapor within the Arctic vortex observed by ILAS.

The two traditional perspectives on memory-reasoning relations-the necessity and constructivist hypotheses-stipulate that the accuracy of children's memory for problem information and the accuracy of their reasoning are closely intertwined, albeit for different reasons. However, contrary to necessity, correlational and experimental dissociations have been found between children's memory for problem information that is determinative in solving certain problems and their solutions of those problems. In these same tasks, age changes in memory for problem information appear to be dissociated from age changes in reasoning. Contrary to constructivism, correlational and experimental dissociations also have been found between children's performance on memory tests for actual experience and memory tests for the meaning of experience. As in memory-reasoning studies, age changes in one type of memory performance do not seem to be closely connected to age changes in the other type of performance. Subsequent experiments have led to dual-process accounts in both the memory and reasoning spheres. The account of memory development features four other principles: parallel verbatim-gist storage, dissociated verbatim-gist retrieval, memorial bases of conscious recollection, and identity/similarity processes. The account of the development of reasoning features three principles: gist extraction, fuzzy-to-verbatim continua, and fuzzy-processing preferences. The fuzzy- processing preference is a particularly important notion because it implies that gist-based intuitive reasoning often suffices to deliver ""logical"" solutions and that such reasoning confers multiple cognitive advantages that enhance accuracy. The explanation of memory-reasoning dissociations in cognitive development then falls out of fuzzy-trace theory's dual-process models of memory and reasoning. More explicitly, in childhood reasoning tasks, it is assumed that both verbatim and gist traces of problem information are stored. Responding accurately to memory tests for presented problem information depends primarily on verbatim memory abilities (preserving traces of that information and accessing them when the appropriate memory probes are administered). However, accurate solutions to reasoning problems depend primarily on gist-memory abilities (extracting the correct gist from problem information, focusing on that gist during reasoning, and accessing reasoning operations that process that gist). Because verbatim and gist memories exhibit considerable dissociation, both during storage and when they are subsequently accessed on memory tests, dissociations of verbatim-based memory performance from gist-based reasoning are predictable. Conversely, associations are predicted in situations in which memory and reasoning are based on the same verbatim traces (Brainerd & Reyna, 1988) and in situations in which memory and reasoning are based on the same gist traces (Reyna & Kiernan, 1994). Fuzzy-trace theory's memory and reasoning principles have been applied in other research domains. Four such domains are developmental cognitive neuro-science studies of false memory, studies of false memory in brain-damaged patients, studies of reasoning errors in judgment and decision making, and studies of retrieval mechanisms in recall. In the first domain, the principles of parallel verbatim-gist storage, dissociated verbatim-gist retrieval, and identity/similarity processes have been used to explain both spontaneous and implanted false reports in children and in the elderly. These explanations have produced some surprising predictions that have been verified: false reports do not merely decline with age during childhood but increase under theoretically specified conditions; reports of events that were not experienced can nevertheless be highly persistent over time; and false reports can be suppressed by retrieving verbatim traces of corresponding true events. In the second domain, the same principles have been invoked to explain why some forms of brain damage lead to elevated levels of false memory and other forms lead to reduced levels of false memory. In the third domain, the principles of gist extraction, fuzzy-to-verbatim continua, and fuzzy-processing preferences have been exploited to formulate a general theory of loci of processing failures in judgment and decision making, cluminating in a developmental account of degrees of rationality that distinguishes more and less advanced reasoning. This theory has in turn been used to formulate local models, such as the inclusion illusions model, that explain the characteristic reasoning errors that are observed on specific judgment and decision-making tasks. Finally, in the fourth domain, a dual-process conception of recall has been derived from the principles of parallel verbatim-gist storage and dissociated verbatim-gist retrieval. In this conception, which has been used to explain cognitive triage effects in recall and robust false recall, targets are recalled either by directly accessing their verbatim traces and reading the retrieved information out of consciousness or by reconstructively processing their gist traces. © 2002 Elsevier B.V.

S4S 0A2, Canada","The Relationlog system is a novel persistent deductive database system for advanced data and knowledge-based applications. It directly supports the storage and inference of data with complex structures, especially data supported in nested relational and complex-object models. The Relationlog system supports the Relationlog query language, which is a typed extension of Datalog with tuples and sets and stands in the same relationship to the nested relational and complex-object models as Datalog stands to the relational model. It also supports an SQL-like data definition language and a declarative data manipulation language. This article introduces the Relationlog language, discusses the system architecture, the design decisions incorporated within its implementation, and our experience in developing the system.

The goal of the project was to determine if the identified needs would be amenable to an alternative healthcare delivery model, such as an academic nursing clinic. Data were collected using the Health Needs and Health Status Survey, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale, interactive participant interviews, key informant interviews and observations. Community residents (N = 242) were typically unmarried, middle-aged, and low income and had multiple chronic physical illnesses, serious and persistent mental illnesses, and/or disabilities. Despite the high identified service need, use of preventative or routine healthcare services was low, with residents using emergency services inappropriately or delaying care until requiring more expensive intensive healthcare services.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; consumer; female; health care planning; health service; human; male; middle aged; nurse; nurse practitioner; poverty; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Community Health Planning; Consumer Participation; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurse Clinicians; Nurse Practitioners; Poverty Areas",,,,,,,,"Badger, T.A.",,,,,,,,08876274,,,"11855466","English","Clin Nurse Spec",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035353010

This paper presents XML based message queue which unifies format of the message and realizes easy data exchange in different applications. First, we present architecture of message by XML. We also propose relevant issues of the message by XML; structural representation and several operations of message by XML. Not only FIFO operation but also advanced operations can be designed using inside information of the message owing to XML. Second, we present message queue by XML. Representation of the message queue by XML and concurrent access of the message queue are proposed. Finally, we report implementation of the XML based message queue using Java programming.

For each of these countries we study the shape of the sectoral distribution of an index of trade specialisation and its evolution over time. Our analysis shows a marked difference between the advanced and the emerging countries as far as the degree of persistence is concerned: the former have in fact a highly persistent trade pattern, whereas the latter show a rapidly changing trade specialisation. However, the two groups of countries are more similar as far as the evolution of the degree of specialisation is concerned. Although emerging countries are still more specialised than the industrialised countries, both groups show a tendency toward a reduced polarisation and a more symmetric distribution of the specialisation index. This evidence is in line with the traditional trade theory, in which changing comparative advantage is the determinant of a changing trade pattern. Contrarily, this evidence does not support the idea that self-reinforcing mechanisms are prominent in international trade specialisation.",,"comparative study; international trade; trade relations",,,,,,,"Amendola, G., Guerrieri, P., Padoan, P.C., International patterns of technological accumulation and trade (1992) Journal of International and Comparative Economics, 1, pp. 173-197; Balassa, B., Trade liberalisation and 'Revealed' comparative advantage (1965) Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies, No 33; Balassa, B., Revealed comparative advantage revisited: An analysis of relative export shares of the industrial countries, 1953-71 (1977) Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies, No 33; Bowen, H.P., On the theoretical interpretation of indices of trade intensity and revealed comparative advantage (1983) Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, 119, pp. 464-472; Bowen, H.P., Hollander, A., Viaene, J.M., (1998) Applied International Trade Analysis, , Macmillan, London; Brasili, A., Epifani, P., Helg, R., (1999) On the Dynamics of Trade Patterns, , LIUC Papers Note. 61, February-March; Cantwell, J., (1989) Technological Innovation and Multinational Corporations, , Blackwell, Oxford; Deardorff, A.V., Testing trade theories and predicting trade flows (1984) Handbook of International Economics, 1. , in: R.W.

Low gender equity is evidenced in the lack of support for women to combine paid employment and childrearing; tax-transfer systems that remain based on the male-breadwinner model of the family; and the retention of gender-oriented roles within the family. Hence, it is argued that an increase in gender equity is a precondition of a rise in fertility from very low levels. At the same time, theorists argue that, in less developed countries, higher levels of gender equity are a necessary condition for achieving lower fertility. The article addresses this apparent contradiction by distinguishing two types of gender equity: gender equity in individual-oriented institutions and gender equity in family-oriented institutions. The argument is made that the transition from very high fertility to replacement-level fertility has been associated with a gradual increase in gender equity primarily within the family itself. In contrast, the further movement to very low fertility is associated with a rapid shift toward high levels of gender equity in individual institutions such as education and market employment, in combination with persistent low levels of gender equity within the family and in family-oriented institutions.",,"demographic transition; family structure; fertility; gender relations",,,,,,,"Abbasi-Shavazi, M.J., Effects of maritial fertility and nuptially on fertility transition in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 1976-1996 (2000) Working Papers in Demography, No. 84, , Canberra: Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University; Chesnais, J.-C., Fertility, family, and social policy in contemporary Western Europe (1996) Population and Development Review, 22 (4), pp. 729-739; Chesnais, J.-C., Below-replacement fertility in the European Union (EU-15): Facts and policies, 1960-1997 (1998) Review of Population and Social Policy, 7, pp. 83-101; (1986) The Decline of Fertility in Europe, , Coale, Ansley J. and Susan Cotts Watkins (eds.); Princeton: Princeton University Press; Derrida, J., (1976) Of Grammatology, , Trans. by G.

Generally speaking, research shows that women are more reluctant than men to allow unpopular groups to exercise their constitutional rights; women also seem to differ from men in their choice of intolerance targets. While we have been cognizant of the existence of the gender gap in political tolerance since the beginning of survey research on the subject, we know less about its etiology. Using data from the 1987 Freedom and Tolerance National Survey and the General Social Survey from the same year, I explore the underpinnings of gender differences in political tolerance. To this end, I scrutinize explanations advanced in previous research on political tolerance (e.g., women's greater religiosity), propositions stemming from feminist theory (e.g., the notion of maternal thinking), as well as others that do not fit neatly into the above two categories (e.g., gender differences in commitment to democratic norms and political expertise). Because the implications of women's intolerance differ depending on whether their intolerance is focused on a single group or dispersed among several groups, I also examine the patterns in men's and women's choices of intolerance targets. Empirical analysis demonstrates that gender differences in commitment to democratic norms and political expertise (through the latter's influence on subscription to democratic norms), as well as threat perceptions, tolerance of uncertainty, and moral traditionalism (through the latter two's influence on threat perceptions), are the principal ""culprits"" for women's intolerance. Men's and women's choices of intolerance targets are largely pluralistically distributed and parallel, with only a few exceptions. Women exhibit a greater preference for the KKK and abortion groups (particularly those pro-choice in their orientation) as their least-liked targets.

Because an advanced missile is required to operate in highly dynamic scenarios, the ability to handle uncertainties is important to the filter of a missile seeker. Sources for uncertainties are various. For instance, when a nonlinear system is linearized, the unmodeled high frequency dynamics could corrupt the filtering process when a large persistent estimation error accumulates. Facing the uncertainties, we propose to develop a robust filter for a seeker so that the uncertainties are precompensated in design. First, the uncertainty in a linear observation equation, which is the approximation of a nonlinear equation, is replaced by an equivalent noise process. The equivalent noise process is added to the nominal system and an auxiliary system is formed. A Kalman filter is designed for the auxiliary system so that an unbiased estimate of the system can be reached. Because the uncertainty in the original system is compensated, the filter for the auxiliary system is robust for the original system in the sense that it provides an error bound for the nominal system with admissible uncertainties.","Extended Kalman filter; Missile seekers; Robust filtering; Uncertainty","Approximation theory; Kalman filtering; Linearization; Nonlinear systems; Missile seekers; Electronic guidance systems",,,,,,,"Berstein, D.S., Haddad, W., Steady state Kalman filtering with an H∞ error bound (1989) System & Control Letters, 12 (1), pp. 9-16; Grimble, M.J., H∞ fixed-lag smoothing filter for scalar systems (1991) IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, 39, pp. 1955-1963; Khargonekar, P.P., Rotea, M.A., Mixed H2/H∞ filtering (1992) Proc. of the 31st Conference on Decision and Control, , Tucson, AZ; Nagpal, K., Khargonekar, P.P., Filtering and smoothing in an H∞ setting (1991) IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control, 36 (2), pp. 152-166; Singer, R.A., Estimating optimal tracking filter performance for manned maneuvering targets (1970) IEEE Trans. on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 6 (4), pp. 473-483; Theodor, Y., Shaked, U., De Souza, C.E., A game theory approach to robust discrete-time H∞-estimation (1994) IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, 42 (6), pp. 1486-1495; Shaked, U., De Souza, C.E., Robust minimum variance filtering (1995) IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, 43 (11), pp. 2474-2483; Shaked, U., Theodor, Y., H∞ estimation: A tutorial (1992) Procs. of the 31st Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 2278-2286. , Tucson, AZ","Cong, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, , Dayton, OH 45435, United States; email: scong@gamma.cs.wright.edu","Drummond O.E.","SPIE",,"Signal and Data Processing of Small Targets 1998","14 April 1998 through 16 April 1998","Orlando, FL",59534,0277786X,,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032325706

As such, JPMQ provides an object-oriented type system for messages, dynamic selection and ordering of messages as well as content-based priorities.

In periods of major technological inventions, a decline in the relative importance of initial conditions raises inequality, enhances mobility, and generates a larger concentration of high-ability individuals in technologically advanced sectors, stimulating future technological progress and growth. However, once technologies become more accessible, mobility is diminished and inequality decreases but becomes more persistent. The reduction in the concentration of ability in technologically advanced sectors diminishes the likelihood of technological breakthroughs and slows future growth.

In order to explain charitable behavior, models based on altruism and on self-interest have been proposed, and a wide array of other motivations have been advanced, among them financial, social pressure, the desire to memorialize someone and religious impulses (Guy and Patton 1988, Odendahl 1990, Harvey 1990, Shervish 1992, Prince, File and Gillespie 1993). Although a consensus of multiple motivations is emerging, due at least in part to the increasing pluralism of the philanthropic sector (Hall 1992), the effect of type of motivation on charitable behaviors remains unstudied. This research provides additional support for the theory of multiple motivations for charitable behaviors and explores the associations between those motivations and a range of charitable behaviors such as future giving intentions, service on boards, charitable recruiting and volunteer activities. Understanding the connections between these attitudes and behaviors will enable development officers of nonprofits to develop more effective relationships with that key constituency--the major donor. Accordingly, the focus of this research is on the affluent, an important component of all individual donors.

These impairments include multifocal and global cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhages, infarctions, optic neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairments, and mood and movement disorders. These findings may encourage the placement of stimulant addiction into the category of organic brain disorders. Functional and microanatomical anomalies in the frontal and temporal cortex as well as other brain regions may be responsible for certain aspects of phenomenology and neuropsychopathology that are characteristic of stimulant polydrug addictions. These may include broad spectrum of deficits in cognition, motivation, and insight; behavioral disinhibition; attention deficits; emotional instability; impulsiveness; aggressiveness; depression; anhedonia; and persistent movement disorders. Although it is still debated whether the hypofrontality and other brain anomalies observed in stimulant abusers are a consequence or an antecedent of drug abuse, this debate seems purely academic and irrelevant with respect to the importance of compensating for these deficits in the development of treatment strategies. The neuropsychiatric impairments accompanying stimulant abuse may contribute to the very high rate of relapse in addicts that can take place after long periods (years) of abstinence. It is possible that the neurological deficits present in stimulant addicts, whether they are primary or secondary to stimulant abuse, are responsible for perpetual drug abuse which may be a form of self-medication (Weiss et al. 1991, 1992). In this context, addiction to stimulants, once fully developed, may represent a true biological dependency on drugs that temporarily compensate for existing neurological deficits. The concept of self-medication by drug addicts is supported by major theories of biological psychiatry. While a majority of drug addicts are polydrug users, there seems to be a preference for a particular type of drug among different populations of addicts. Addicts who experience distress, anxious dysphoria, and turbulent anger prefer the calming actions of opiates, whereas addicts with preceding attention deficit disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder often prefer stimulants (Khantzian 1985). Figure 1 presents conceptual relationships between brain damage and cocaine/stimulant abuse. More clinical studies are needed to establish unequivocally the epidemiological relationships between preexisting neurological deficits-resulting either from genetic, developmental, traumatic, or neurotoxic factors- and vulnerability to drug addictions. Nonetheless, deducing from the results of preclinical studies, it is conceivable that individuals with neurological deficits associated with attention deficit disorder, developmental neuroanatomical abnormalities, lead poisoning, alcoholism, posttraumatic brain lesions, and PTSD may be more vulnerable to stimulant addiction. This notion has significant empirical support as preclinical studies have shown that animals with lesioned prefrontal cortex became supersensitive to cocaine (Schenk et al. 1991) and animals with lesions at the amygdala, VTA, or raphe nuclei manifest more rapid acquisition of amphetamine self-administration than control rats (Deminiere et al. 1989). The above arguments, postulating neuropathology as an intrinsic component of stimulant addiction, should be taken into consideration with the caveat that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogenous and addicts may express varying stages and degrees of the disease as determined by environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, it is likely that stimulant addicts who have less advanced neuropathology may recover spontaneously after detoxification with proper nutritional and psychotherapeutic support if they can sustain abstinence.

However, there has yet to be a more philosophical explanation of what it would mean for our aims and practices as nurse educators if we were to take seriously the notion of nursing education within the context of higher education. This paper analyses the role of the university and raises the questions: What should higher education mean today? What should higher education mean for nursing? In response to the former question it is suggested there cannot be a total distinction between the concept 'higher education' and the socio-political context. Higher education has to be realized in particular historical societies and there is likely to be much controversy over how this should be done. In response to the latter question it is suggested that to warrant the title nursing 'higher education' the process should promise a freeing of the mind but also beyond, to bring about a new level of self-empowerment in the individual student. In essence, it should contain an emancipatory element. It is the articulation of normative aspirations such as these, that is so strikingly absent from so much of the debate relating to nursing education merging with higher education. Nursing education must not however fall victim to 'academic drift' which has often been regarded as a distinctive and persistent feature of higher education. It might be proposed that student nurses who move from an educational to a practice setting are subjected to 'a competing paradigm of occupational vocationalism'. Criticisms such as these have led to a reconceptualization of the theory-practice dichotomy and partnership in training and education between the 'trainers' and practising professionals. What is needed is a new model of nursing education. A model which is an amalgam of both the liberal and vocational educational traditions. Implementations of such a model would demand that the curriculum is organised around problem-based learning. This means adopting a curriculum in which 'knowing how' and 'knowing that' forms of knowledge are equally emphasized. Simultaneously, student' and practitiones' contextual knowledge would be advanced by collaborative research between educationalists and practitiones. The implication is for nursing education to be based more in the reality of practice. © 1995 Pearson Professional Ltd.",,"article; curriculum; human; model; nonbiological model; nursing education; Curriculum; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Human; Models, Educational; Models, Nursing",,,,,,,"Acton, Gough, McCormack, The clinical nurse tutor debate (1992) Nursing Times, 88 (32), pp. 38-40. , (Aug. 5); Barnett, Becker, Barrows, Models of professional preparation:a taxonomy of problem-based learning methods (1986) Medical Education, 20, pp. 481-486; Blais, Constructivism: a theoretical revolution in teaching (1988) Journal of Developmental Education, 11 (3), pp. 2-7; Cork, Pharmacy nursing and teacher education (1987) Studies in Higher Education, 12 (1), pp. 51-63; Barnett, (1990) The idea of higher education, , Open University Press, Newbury Park; Burgess, Pratt, (1970) Policy and practices: the colleges of advanced technology, , Allen Lane, Buckingham; Cevero, (1988) Effective continuing education for professions, , Jossey-Bass, London; Champion, Professional collaboration: the lecturer practitioner role (1992) Developing professional education, , M.

This system tested the ability of technicians to interact with the aircraft and use a portable maintenance aid to increase diagnostic accuracy and decrease the time necessary to make the repair. Results of the field test show enhanced levels of performance can be achieved at all technician levels by using a computer-aided maintenance system. The average fault isolation time was reduced 26% and diagnostic accuracy was improved by 92% over standard flight line practices.",,"Computer applications; Expert systems; Failure analysis; Knowledge based systems; Maintenance; Advanced maintenance systems; Automated maintenance systems; Computer aided maintenance; Field tests; Integrated diagnostics; Military aircraft",,,,,,,,"Schroeder, John B.",,"IEEE Reliability Soc;American Soc for Quality Control;IES;AIAA;SAE;et al","Publ by IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Proceedings of the 1992 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium","21 January 1992 through 23 January 1992","Las Vegas, NV, USA",17346,0149144X,0780305213,PRMSC,,"English","Proc Annu Reliab Maintainability Symp",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026836302

The author proposes that specializations have proliferated because they have been functional for the growth and legitimation of the profession. Specifically, they have provided opportunities for more sociologists to make recognized contributions to knowledge during a prolonged period of increasing competition for research recognition and support. The emphasis on research also has advanced the status of faculty within the university. Because the source of new specialties has been changes in society, the domain of sociology has continued to expand, promoting student enrollments. However, the growth of the profession has been purchased at the price of the coherence of the discipline. Moreover, the fiscal crisis of the university may make the eclectic image of sociology departments a liability to their efforts to protect faculty. In the future, unionization may become an alternative to departmentalization and professionalization. Meanwhile, a new concentration on the development of the discipline may be the most effective way to ensure support of the profession. Our principal goal should be to develop a general, critical theory of society. As a first step, all studies should be addressed to and classified in terms of the core concepts that define the distinctive concerns of the discipline. © 1983 Human Sciences Press.",,,,,,,,,"Alpert, (1961) Emile Durkheim and his Sociology, , Russell & Russell, New York; Bates, A.P., Reid, S., The sociology major in accredited colleges and universities (1971) The American Sociologist, 6, pp. 243-248; Berger, Luckmann, (1967) The Social Construction of Reality, , Anchor Books, New York; Bernard, L.L., The teaching of sociology in the United States in the last fifty years (1944) American Journal of Sociology, 50, pp. 534-48; Bernard, L.L., The teaching of sociology in the United States (1909) American Journal of Sociology, 15, pp. 164-213; Caplow, Reece, (1958) The Academic Marketplace, , Basic Books, New York; Carnegie Council on Policy Studies in Higher Education 1977 “Academics are going up again.” Campus Scene (January 24): 5; Catton, Jr., Dunlap, Environmental sociology: A new paradigm (1978) The American Sociologist, 13, pp. 41-49; Chapin, F.S., Report on questionnaire of Committee on Teaching (1911) American Journal of Sociology, 16, pp. 774-793; Chubin, State of the field: The conceptualization of scientific specialties (1976) The Sociological Quarterly, 17, pp. 448-476; Crane, Social structure in a group of scientists: A test of the ‘invisible college’ hypothesis (1969) American Sociological Review, 34, pp. 335-51; DeMartini, Constraints to the development of curricula in applied sociology (1980) The American Sociologist, 15, pp. 138-145; Durkheim, (1938) The Rules of Sociological Method, , Collier-MacMillan Limited, The Free Press of Glencoe, London; Durkheim, (1933) The Division of Labor in Society, , Collier-MacMillan Limited, The Free Press of Glencoe, London; 1974 “Undergraduate sociology curriculum emphasizes ‘practical’ courses.” 3:4; (1956) Aspects of Sociology, , Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, Beacon, Boston; Garvey, W.D. and Tomita K. 1972 “Continuity of productivity by scientists in the years, 1968–1971.” Science Studies (Oct.) 2:379–383; Gates, Sociology in small U.S. liberal arts colleges (1969) American Sociologist, 4, pp. 324-329; Gieryn, Problem retention and problem change in science (1978) Sociological Inquiry, 48, pp. 96-115; Hagstrom, Competition in science (1974) American Sociological Review, 39, pp. 1-18; Haller, Edgar, Rural sociology in 1967 (1968) The American Sociologist, 3, pp. 289-290; Harmon, (1965) Profiles of Ph.D.'s in the Sciences: Summary Report on the Follow-up of Doctorate Cohorts, 1935–1960, p. 1293. , Nat'l.

Analysis of 1 54 clinical cases of COA revealed the presence of associated cardiac anomalies which could obstruct fetal blood flow to the ascending aorta in many cases. Systolic left ventricular outflow tract was significantly narrow in cases of ventricular septal defect (VSD) associated with COA in comparison with the isolated VSD (p < 0.01). Good quality aortograms obtained from 41 cases of COA were analysed. Ages ranged from one month to 20 years and major cardiac anomalies were associated in 25 cases. Age-matched 37 cases were studied as the controls. In COA, the isthmus was narrower than the controls in 88% of the cases, and in the remaining it was low in the normal range. Severely hypoplastic isthmus in early infancy became the adult type after 5 years in one of the 4 cases which had repeated aortography. Localized stenosis at the distal end of isthmus was present in 89%, and absent in 11% (4 cases). In these 4, isthmal narrowing was associated with major intracardiac anomalies, large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The anterior ostium to the descending aorta was obstructed by constricted ductus arteriosus in some infants with COA. These angiographic findings are compatible with the following working hypothesis: ischemic hypoplasia results from prenatal decrease of blood flow to the ascending aorta, and localized stenosis is related to abnormal distribution of the ductal tissue to the descending aorta and post-natal constriction of the ductus.arteriosus. In 3 infants COA was associated with persistent fifth aortic arch. © 1982, The Japanese Circulation Society.

Theories from the science of ethology, especially, could have predicted the growing focus on local sub-cultures in developed and developing countries alike. Evolutionary theory suggests such a focus must be evaluated in terms of species survival. A theoretical model is advanced which suggests that the persistent human propensity to identify with small groups is a consequence of our evolution as a mammal; that is an essentially primitive but universal response which must be accommodated even while the cultural evolution of human society requires cooperation on a much larger and more impersonal scale. The model takes the concept of ""proxemics"", first advanced by E.T. Hall to describe culturally determined spatial behavior, as one side of an equation. Based on the theories of P.D. MacLean and J.B. Calhoun, proxemic behavior is considered to be a cognitive response by phylogenetically older parts of the brain. The other side of the equation is a concept, termed ""distemics"", which deals with the more impersonal spatial relationships that have emerged through the peculiarly human capacity for abstract thought. The basic hypothesis is that stable, well functioning and reasonably satisfactory human habitats require a balance of spaces designed to facilitate behavior on both levels, and that human survival and the continued evolution of culture require their elaboration on a global scale. The model is applied to the study of a small industrial American city of 40 000 people, which has been regionally isolated from larger metropolitan areas. From this study a four part hypothesis for further research emerged which posits that the critical factor for social stability is the in-migration of alien sub-cultures. When such in-migration is absent ethnic and other proxemic differences tend to merge into a common culture. However, lack of distemic relationships, which are dependent on social diversity, tends to lead to social and economic stagnation. On the other hand, new populations can be accepted amicably only if local life styles are buffered by zones for distemic interaction. Over a sufficient period of time, new proxemic cultures develop from such interaction, and cultural evolution proceeds to a new proxemic-distemic cycle. © 1978.",,,,,,,,,"Calhoun, Space and the strategy of life (1971) Behavior and Environment, pp. 329-387. , A.H.

Phlebography was carried out during surgery with the patient supine and in a 45 degree anti-Trendelenburg position to stimulate an ""erect"" posture. In all 25 patients with a varicocele, valvular insufficiency was demonstrated at the renal-spermatic vein junction. When visualized, the position of the left adrenal vein in all instances was medial to or opposite the renal-internal spermatic vein confluence. This observation, reinforced by simultaneous determinations of cortisol levels in the internal spermatic and antecubital veins, practically excluded the validity of the theory of adrenal hormonal suppression of testicular tissues. In 40% of subfertile patients with a varicocele, double internal spermatic veins and reflux to the distended external spermatic (cremasteric) venous plexus were demonstrated. In no instance were such phenomena observed in the control groups. The not-infrequent failure of operative correction of varicocele seems to relate directly to such overlooked pathology. Broad clinical application of operative phlebography, especially in recurrent, persistent, or clinically advanced cases, will detect such anomalies and should reduce significantly the operative failures in the surgical correction of varicocele.Intraoperative internal spermatic vein phlebography was performed on 20 subfertile patients with a varicocele; 5 infertile patients with varicoceles; and on 5 patients with left-sided indirect inguinal hernias without fertility problems who served as controls. Phlebography was carried out during surgery with the patient supine and in a 45 degree anti-Trendelenburg position to simulate an ""erect"" posture. In all 25 patients with varicocele, valvular insufficiency was demonstrated at the renal-spermatic vein junction. When visualized, the position of the left adrenal vein in all instances was medial to or opposite the renal-internal spermatic vein confluence. This observation, reinforced by simultaneous determinations of cortisol levels in the internal spermatic and antecubital veins, practically excluded the validity of the theory of adrenal hormonal suppression of testicular tissues. In 40% of subfertile patients with a varicocele, double internal spermatic veins and reflux to the distended external spermatic (cremasteric) venous plexus were demonstrated. No such phenomena were observed in the control groups. The not-infrequent failure of operative correction of varicocele seems to relate directly to overlooked pathology. Broad clinical applications of operative phlebography, especially in recurrent, persistent, or clinically advanced cases, will detect such anomalies and should reduce significantly the operative failure in the surgical correction of varicocele. Likewise, through the use of this technique, therapeutic results of high ligation of the spermatic vein may be substantially improved.",,"adult; article; biology; genital system; histology; human; Infertility--etiology; male; male genital system; male infertility; phlebography; physiology; radiography; reproduction; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon migration; surgery; testis; treatment; urogenital system; varicocele; vascularization; Biology; Genitalia; Genitalia, Male; Histology; Infertility--etiology; Men; Physiology; Reproduction; Sperm Count; Sperm Transport; Surgery; Testis; Treatment; Urogenital System; Adult; Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; Phlebography; Testis; Varicocele",,,,,,,,"Sayfan, J.",,,,,,,,00150282,,,"658479","English","Fertil.

Some of the theoretical assumptions underlying these discussions are examined on the basis of empirical observations on the establishment of steel-making facilities in developing economies. Steel mills have become regarded as part of the necessary infrastructure in many countries; thus, a sufficiently large number of installations have occurred to permit some generalizations. It is found that the achievement of optimal plant sizes, in the sense of static economic theory, proves elusive at best in the dynamic setting of ambitious growth objectives. Completely aside from political considerations, various economic factors not only militate against the projection of an optimal scale of operations, but also make a commitment to such a scale inadvisable. Besides, little evidence is found to suggest that advanced techniques are not sufficiently flexible in terms of input and size requirements to permit their transfer to developing countries. One may hazard the conclusion that market, rather than technological, rigidities could prevent the realization of a new industry's full potential. © 1975.",,,,,,,,,"Adelman, Morris, Performance criteria for evaluating development potential an operational approach (1968) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 82 (2), pp. 260-280; American Iron And Steel Institute (annual) Annual Statistical Report.

The intensive study of NLC since the I.G.Y. shows that these clouds occur over North America as frequently as in Europe and the U.S.S.R. Further, NLC displays are generally quite persistent and last for periods up to and greater than 5 hours, but individual parts (particularly the billow structure) often form and decay within a few minutes or tens of minutes. The rapid structural changes in the clouds indicate that the layer in which they are formed is well stirred and often in wave motion. In the Northern Hemisphere NLC are observed predominantly between June 1 and August 15, with the peak of activity occurring around 20 to 30 days after the summer solstice and the brightest and most widespread displays taking place between July 1 and August 15. The optimum latitude for NLC observations is around 60° N. NLC occur far more frequently than previously supposed - during the month of July, NLC are seen nearly every night in some part of the Northern Hemisphere. An observer at 60° N might expect to see NLC on about 75% of the clear nights during the month of July. Occasionally NLC displays extend over an area in excess of millions of square kilometers. Recent studies of NLC in the Southern Hemisphere have resulted in the proof of the existence of NLC there and in the determination of some of their characteristics. Southern Hemisphere NLC were found to have a general drift motion toward the west-north-west. NLC were observed there (at 53° S) during the period December 25-January 20, with the brightest and most widespread displays occurring during the first four days of January. A comparison of these results for 53° S with those obtained from stations at 53° N suggests that NLC in the Southern Hemisphere have the same apparent frequency of occurrence with respect to the solstice as NLC in the Northern Hemisphere and that the clouds are likely to be seen at 60° S from December 1 to February 15. Geometrical considerations of NLC observations and observational results show that the clouds are likely to be seen only during the time periods when the solar depression angle (SDA) is between 6° and 16° and that they are most easily detected at SDA from 9° to 14°. At SDA greater than 16°, the 82 km level where the NLC are formed is no longer illuminated by the sun even at the observer's horizon. An atmospheric screening height of around 30 km appears to be operative in the case of NLC. The collection and statistical analysis of all available data on NLC provides the following picture of their characteristics in the Northern Hemisphere: Color: bluish white Height: (average) 82.7 km Latitude of Observations: 45° to 80°, best at about 60° Season for Observations: March through October, best in June through August Times for Observations: nautical and part of astronomical twilight, SDA = 6° to 16° Spatial Extent: 10 000 to more than 4000 000 km2 Duration: several minutes to more than 5 hours Average Velocity: 40 m/sec towards SW; individual bands often move in different directions and at different speeds than the display as a whole Thickness: 0.5 to 2 km Vertical Wave Amplitude: 1.5 to 3 km Average Particle Diameter: about 0.3 microns Number Density of Particles: 10-2 to 1 per cm3 Temperature in Presence of NLC: about 135° K The available evidence suggests that the dust particles in NLC are of extraterrestrial origin and that they have a volatile coating, the nature of which is uncertain at this time although it is largely assumed to be water substance. The fact that no uncoated particles with diameters greater than 0.20 micron were found in the NLC samples obtained over Sweden in 1962 indicates that particles of this size are absent in the regions above and below the cloud layer. This result suggests that the larger particles may be formed in the NLC layer by coagulation of the smaller ones and that these particles are retained in the NLC layer by some mechanism such as large-scale vertical motions. Calculations of the fall speed of NLC particles indicate that the particles are likely to be of low density (below 1 g/cm3) and/or non-spherical in shape. In view of the large uncertainties remaining as to the nature of NLC particles and the characteristics of the region in which they form, a definitive theory explaining their formation must await further experimental data. For a satisfactory understanding of NLC more and better information is required on the following variables: 1) Height, thickness, vertical wave amplitudes, horizontal wave lengths and wave speeds of NLC, 2) Brightness, polarization, and spectrum of NLC, 3) Wind and temperature in the NLC region both in the presence and absence of NLC, 4) Water vapor concentration around the mesopause in the presence and absence of NLC, 5) Concentration, composition, and shape of particles in the NLC region both in the presence and absence of clouds, 6) Nature of the volatile coating on NLC particles, 7) Height of the turbopause when NLC are present and absent. The first two items can be measured from the ground, but the others will presumably require rocket measurements. A knowledge of the wind and temperature distribution would permit a decision as to whether the observed wave forms are internal gravity waves or interface waves. A knowledge of the temperature and water vapor content during the presence and absence of NLC would also be helpful in the investigation of condensation processes on NLC particles and the changes of NLC appearance. Polarization measurements at scattering angles greater than 90° would assist in determining whether NLC become visible because of an increased concentration of particles at the mesopause or because of an increase in particle size due to coating. Better information about the nature of the particles would help in making more definite theoretical deductions from ground-based optical measurements and more reliable theoretical estimates about the sinking velocities important for the theory of NLC formation. A measurement of the height of the turbopause and the turbulent state of the atmosphere in the region in question, by means of artificial vapor trails, could make an important contribution to the Chapman-Kendall theory which postulates a descent of the turbopause to the NLC region. Because of the sometimes observed disappearance of NLC when auroral displays occur, a particularly interesting experiment would be a sequence of temperature measurements in the NLC region when aurora and NLC occur together in order to see whether a warming of the region due to auroral heating can, in fact, be discovered and whether such a warming leads to significant changes or even disappearance of the NLC by removing the coating from the nuclei or by greater turbulence which would reduce the particle concentration. NLC are, even in the latitudes and seasons when they occur, relatively rare phenomena, but their study is related to many other problems connected with the mesopause, the lowest layer of the ionosphere, the lowest fringe of the auroral layer, and with the influx of cosmic dust. Thus their continued exploration can contribute greatly to our knowledge, not only of this particular level, but of our whole atmospheric and space environment. © 1966 D.

The evidence for its hereditary basis in man has been reviewed. By inbreeding a strain of Lakeland Terriers in which the condition had been observed, it was established that connation of the first and second incisors in dogs is inherited; connation was produced in at least 1 dog of each litter. A large number of variant forms of connation were observed. Material from dogs obtained at the 34th day of gestation to 13 days after birth was submitted to serial sectioning. From a study of the dogs with unilateral involvement, it was shown that persistence of the interdental lamina is the primary developmental abnormality and that this is controlled by the same genes in the maxillae and mandible. Based on these observations, a new theory regarding the mechanism of connation is advanced; that is, herniation of the enamel organs occurs between the two layers of persistent interdental lamina to effect their union; whereas, if the persistent lamina breaks near one tooth germ, its neighboring enamel organ may suddenly burst between the two layers of lamina and produce the appearance of connation with a supernumerary tooth. © 1966, SAGE Publications.

Sex cycles of many kinds have been charted and recorded by biologists. One sex cycle whose ebb and flow has never been adequately investigated is the perpetual cycle of interest in ways and means to pre-determine sex. Nearly two centuries ago Drelincourt (called Felincourt, by our latest author to put us right on sex) listed 262 theories of sex determination. Doubtless there were some duplications among these and many of the ""new"" theories of sex determination ""discovered"" since Drelincourt no doubt are reiterations of those on his two hundred year old list. In any event, the problem has challenged human ingenuity for a very long time. Among recent theories, that advanced by Unterberger in 1930 has had a persistent popularity. In 1932, at the time of the Sixth International Genetics Congress, a ""curbstone"" account of Unterberger's theories, apparently delivered in New York City, captured perhaps more newspaper space than all of the actual Congress program put together. For months after that the ""fan mail"" of all agencies which might give information about sex determination bulged with inquiries and suggestions, offers of cooperation, and even with ""proof"" of the efficiency of one method or another. This flurry of interest in Unterberger's plan for controlling sex was discussed by Cole and Johansson in this JOURNAL in 1933. © 1940 Oxford University Press.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00221503,,,,"English","J.

They are indiscriminately applied to three more or less distinct boiler phenomena: (1) actual foam on the surface of the water, (2) mere violent ebullition, and (3) small bubbles throughout the mass of the water. No general chemical theory of foaming has been advanced and there are many contradictions of the prevailing notion that sodium salts cause foaming. This paper advances a theory according to which soluble salts in the water by creating a difference in concentration between the surface and the mass of the liquid make possible the formation of films. These films, however, if caused by the usual inorganic salts —sodium salts, for example—in a boiler water, are not viscous enough to have more than a momentary existence and therefore never cause serious trouble. If at the same time finely divided solid matter is present—loose scale and sludge—the films will be stabilized and a persistent foam will result. An extensive series of experiments with various mixtures in flasks showed no exceptions to this theory. Solutions were prepared in which the surface tension of the liquid was lowered as well as some in which it was raised. In all these solutions finely divided solids produced foam. All these foams stabilized by solid matter can be destroyed by a trace of castor oil. © 1924, American Chemical Society.
