The resulted propagation characteristics are therefore very different compared to mass infections and cannot be well captured by existing propagation models. In this paper, we take the first step to model social worm propagation for the APT using a novel proactive give-up factor, by which the worm can consult to actively postpone or stop unnecessary infections in order to keep the propagation stealthy (inversely in terms of the size of infected population) and long-term (in terms of the number of infection time epochs), meanwhile maintaining the reachability to the targets (in terms of the connectivity from sources to targets). Our basic idea is to derive such a factor for each node as a give-up probability or a delayed value according to the node's relative location with respect to sources and targets. We note new infections may lead the relative locations for each node vary, and accordingly model the factor updating upon the propagation progress. To validate our design, we have conducted rigorous theoretical analysis, as well as extensive experiments by running simulated APT worms over the real-world social network topologies. The results have successfully confirmed the effectiveness of our model in simulating APT worm's propagation with targeted, stealthy and long-term properties altogether. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced persistent threat; Propagation model; Social worm; Targeted intrusion; Worm propagation","Crack propagation; Malware; Advanced persistent threat; Large population; Mass propagation; Propagation characteristics; Propagation modeling; Reachability; Relative location; Social worm; Targeted intrusion; Worm propagation; Topology",,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai: 18ZR1415000, D18003

The selection of suitable features for detecting targeted cyber attacks is crucial to achieving high performance and to address limited computational and storage costs. The evaluation was performed on a semi-synthetic dataset, which combined the CICIDS2017 dataset and the Contagio malware dataset. The CICIDS2017 dataset is a benchmark dataset in the intrusion detection field and the Contagio malware dataset contains real advanced persistent threat (APT) attack traces. Several different combinations of datasets were used to increase variety in background data and contribute to the quality of results. For the feature extraction, the CICflowmeter tool was used. For the selection of suitable features, a correlation analysis including an in-depth feature investigation by boxplots is provided. Based on that, several suitable features were allocated into different feature sets. The influences of these feature sets on the detection capabilities were investigated in detail with the local outlier factor method. The focus was especially on attacks detected with different feature sets and the influences of the background on the detection capabilities with respect to the local outlier factor method. Based on the results, we could determine a superior feature set, which detected most of the malicious flows. © 2021 by the authors.

Since current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and alert correlation systems do not correlate low-level operating system events with network events and use alert correlation instead of event correlation, the intruders use low and hybrid events in order to distribute the attack vector, hide malwares behaviors, and therefore make detection difficult for such detection systems. In this paper, a new approach for detecting hybrid and low-level attacks, which are prevalent in APTs, is proposed. The proposed approach uses low-level interception and correlates operating system events with network events based on the semantic relationships that are defined between the entities in system ontology. In this scheme, malicious events, especially the events implicitly violate the security policies, are deduced and detected based on the event relations and defined security policies. Also, the proposed approach can track information flows between the existing subjects using a memory transition/manipulation model to reconstruct distributed attack vectors. Evaluation of the proposed approach on a computer network which contains many APTs scenarios shows the effectiveness of our detection approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced persistent threat; Low-level attack; Malware; Ontology; Semantic-based correlation","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Ontology; Security systems; Semantics; Advanced persistent threat; Alert correlation; Detection approach; Distributed attack; Information flows; Intrusion Detection Systems; Low-level attack; Semantic relationships; Malware",,,,,,,,"Cohen, F., Computer viruses: theory and experiments (1987) Comput.

This class of threats, well known as advanced persistent threats (APTs), are those that every nation and well-established organization fears and wants to protect itself against. While nation-sponsored APT attacks will always be marked by their sophistication, APT attacks that have become prominent in corporate sectors do not make it any less challenging for the organizations. The rate at which the attack tools and techniques are evolving is making any existing security measures inadequate. As defenders strive to secure every endpoint and every link within their networks, attackers are finding new ways to penetrate into their target systems. With each day bringing new forms of malware, having new signatures and behavior that is close to normal, a single threat detection system would not suffice. While it requires time and patience to perform APT, solutions that adapt to the changing behavior of APT attacker(s) are required. Several works have been published on detecting an APT attack at one or two of its stages, but very limited research exists in detecting APT as a whole from reconnaissance to cleanup, as such a solution demands complex correlation and fine-grained behavior analysis of users and systems within and across networks. Through this survey paper, we intend to bring all those methods and techniques that could be used to detect different stages of APT attacks, learning methods that need to be applied and where to make your threat detection framework smart and undecipherable for those adapting APT attackers. We also present different case studies of APT attacks, different monitoring methods, and mitigation methods to be employed for fine-grained control of security of a networked system. We conclude this paper with different challenges in defending against APT and opportunities for further research, ending with a note on what we learned during our writing of this paper. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","Advanced persistent threat; APT; intrusion detection; targeted attacks","Intrusion detection; Network security; Networked control systems; Surveys; Advanced persistent threat; Complex correlation; Fine-grained control; Mitigation methods; Research opportunities; targeted attacks; Threat detection system; Tools and techniques; Malware",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 61571375, 61628201, DGE-1723440, OAC-1642031, SaTC-1528099

APT refers to a persistent, multi-stage attack with the intention to compromise the system and gain information from the targeted system, which has the potential to cause significant damage and substantial financial loss. The accurate detection and prediction of APT is an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a novel machine learning-based system entitled MLAPT, which can accurately and rapidly detect and predict APT attacks in a systematic way. The MLAPT runs through three main phases: (1) Threat detection, in which eight methods have been developed to detect different techniques used during the various APT steps. The implementation and validation of these methods with real traffic is a significant contribution to the current body of research; (2) Alert correlation, in which a correlation framework is designed to link the outputs of the detection methods, aims to identify alerts that could be related and belong to a single APT scenario; and (3) Attack prediction, in which a machine learning-based prediction module is proposed based on the correlation framework output, to be used by the network security team to determine the probability of the early alerts to develop a complete APT attack. MLAPT is experimentally evaluated and the presented system is able to predict APT in its early steps with a prediction accuracy of 84.8%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced persistent threat; Alert correlation; Cyber attacks; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning; Malware","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Crime; Forecasting; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Losses; Network security; Advanced persistent threat; Alert correlation; Attack prediction; Cyber-attacks; Detection methods; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-stage attack; Prediction accuracy; Malware",,,,,,,,"Conti, M., Dehghantanha, A., Franke, K., Watson, S., (2018), Internet of things security and forensics: Challenges and opportunities; HaddadPajouh, H., Dehghantanha, A., Khayami, R., Choo, K.-K.R., A deep recurrent neural network based approach for internet of things malware threat hunting, Future Generation Computer Systems; MacDermott, A., Baker, T., Shi, Q., Iot forensics: Challenges for the ioa era (2018) New Technologies, Mobility and Security, NTMS, 2018 9th IFIP International Conference on, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Morgan, S., Hackerpocalypse: A Cybercrime Revelation, Cybercrime Report (2016), Cybersecurity Ventures; Epiphaniou, G., Karadimas, P., Ismail, D.K.B., Al-Khateeb, H., Dehghantanha, A., Choo, K.-K.R., Non-reciprocity compensation combined with turbo codes for secret key generation in vehicular ad hoc social iot networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal; Walker-Roberts, S., Hammoudeh, M., Dehghantanha, A., A systematic review of the availability and efficacy of countermeasures to internal threats in healthcare critical infrastructure, IEEE Access; Aparicio-Navarro, F.J., Kyriakopoulos, K.G., Gong, Y., Parish, D.J., Chambers, J.A., Using pattern-of-life as contextual information for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 22177-22193; Al-Khateeb, H.M., Epiphaniou, G., Alhaboby, Z.A., Barnes, J., Short, E., Cyberstalking: Investigating formal intervention and the role of corporate social responsibility (2017) Telemat.

They are customized, multi-vector, staged in multiple flows and targeted. Moreover, new hacking playgrounds appeared to reach mobile network, modern architectures and smart cities. For that purpose, malware use different entry points and plug-ins. In addition, they are now deploying several techniques for obfuscation, camouflage and analysis resistance. On the other hand, antiviral protections are positioning innovative approaches exposing malicious indicators and anomalies, revealing assumptions of the limitations of the anti-antiviral mechanisms. Primarily, this paper exposes a state of art in computer virology and then introduces a new concept to create undetectable malware based on the blockchain technology. It summarizes techniques adopted by malicious software to avoid functionalities implemented for viral detection and presents the implementation of new viral techniques that leverage the blockchain network. © 2018 IEEE.","APT; Blockchain; K-ary Virus; Malicious program; Malware","Blockchain; Computer crime; Personal computing; Antiviral mechanisms; Cyber-attacks; Entry point; Innovative approaches; Malicious program; Modern architectures; Multiple flows; Viral detection; Malware",,,,,,,,"Filiol, E., Malicious cryptology and mathematics (2012) Cryptography and Security in Computing, , Intech; You, I., Yim, K., Malware obfuscation techniques: A brief survey (2010) Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 297-300. , IEEE; Cohen, F., Computer viruses: Theory and experiments (1987) Computers &Security, 6 (1), pp. 22-35; Moubarak, J., Chamoun, M., Filiol, E., Comparative study of recent mea malware phylogeny (2017) Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS), 2017 2nd International Conference on, pp. 16-20. , IEEE; Moubarak, J., Filiol, E., Chamoun, M., Comparative analysis of blockchain technologies and tor network: Two faces of the same reality?

Among the serious attacks, Advanced Persistent threat (APT) has emerged as a big challenge to the cyber security hitting selected companies and organisations. The main objectives of APT are data exfiltration and intelligence appropriation. As part of the APT life cycle, an attacker creates a Point of Entry (PoE) to the target network. This is usually achieved by installing malware on the targeted machine to leave a back-door open for future access. A common technique employed to breach into the network, which involves the use of social engineering, is the spear phishing email. These phishing emails may contain disguised executable files. This paper presents the disguised executable file detection (DeFD) module, which aims at detecting disguised exe files transferred over the network connections. The detection is based on a comparison between the MIME type of the transferred file and the file name extension. This module was experimentally evaluated and the results show a successful detection of disguised executable files. © 2018 ACM.","Advanced persistent threat; Cyber attacks; Disguised executable file; Intrusion detection system; Malware; Spear-phishing emails","Crime; Electronic mail; Intrusion detection; Life cycle; Losses; Malware; Network security; Advanced persistent threat; Cyber-attacks; Executable files; Intrusion Detection Systems; Spear phishing; Computer crime",,,,,,,,"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nhs-cyber-attack/, The-Sun, NHS cyber attack, Accessed: 01-09-2017; Walker-Roberts, S., Hammoudeh, M., Dehghantanha, A., A systematic review of the availability and efficacy of countermeasures to internal threats in healthcare critical infrastructure (2018) IEEE Access; Salem, A., Rabie, K.M., Hamdi, K.A., Alsusa, E., Tonello, A.M., Physical layer security of cooperative relaying power-line communication systems (2016) International Symposium on Power Line Communications, , IEEE; Badarneh, O.S., Sofotasios, P.C., Muhaidat, S., Cotton, S.L., Rabie, K., Al-Dhahir, N., (2018) On the Secrecy Capacity of Fisher-snedecor F Fading Channels, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1805.09260; Salem, A., Hamdi, K.A., Rabie, K.M., Performance analysis of secrecy capacity for two hop af relay networks with zero forcing (2015) Communications (ICC), 2015 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 7353-7358. , IEEE; Salem, A., Hamdi, K.A., Rabie, K.M., Physical layer security with rf energy harvesting in af multi-antenna relaying networks (2016) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 64 (7), pp. 3025-3038; Morgan, S., Hackerpocalypse: A cybercrime revelation (2016) 2016 Cybercrime Report, Cybersecurity Ventures; MacDermo, A., Baker, T., Shi, Q., Iot forensics: Challenges for the ioa era (2018) New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS), 2018 9th IFIP International Conference on, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Asim, M., Yautsiukhin, A., Brucker, A.D., Baker, T., Shi, Q., Lempereur, B., Security policy monitoring of bpmn-based service compositions (2018) Journal of So.ware: Evolution and Process, p. e1944; Al-Sharif, S., Iqbal, F., Baker, T., Khattack, A., White-hat hacking framework for promoting security awareness (2016) New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS), 2016 8th IFIP International Conference on, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Al Sharif, S., Al Ali, M., Al Reqabi, N., Iqbal, F., Baker, T., Marrington, A., Magec: An image searching tool for detecting forged images in forensic investigation (2016) 8th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security; Ghafir, I., Prenosil, V., Advanced persistent threat attack detection: An overview (2014) International Journal of Advances in Computer Networks and Its Security (IJCNS), 4 (4), pp. 50-54. , ISSN 2250-3757; Wood, P., Nisbet, M., Egan, G., Johnston, N., Haley, K., Krishnappa, B., Tran, T.-K., Hittel, S., (2012) Symantec Internet Security Threat Report Trends for 2011, p.

Botnet is a digital weapon used by attackers to commit cybercrime in stealthiest way for all type of illegal online activity. Botnet is well articulated attack responsible for many malicious activities in large volume and mass effective against any targeted organization such as confidential data theft, financial loss, distribution of pirated products, e-business extortion and network or service disruption. Because of its global nature of infection and innovative covert techniques of malware development to evade detection, it is also known as advance persistent threat. An analysis of this APT revealed the advancement in sophistication of bot malware by encryption methods, concealed network connections and silent escape as an effective tool for profit-motivated e-crime. Reverse engineering is procedure to analyze malware to classify its type, hazard, impact on machine, information outflow and removal of signature technique. Botnet (APT) detection needs improvised process to identify the channel, architecture and encryption weakness. In bot examination; Programming style, network protocol and behavior analysis can mitigate the APT by creating signature, prototype of behavior based approach and elimination of C&C servers. Reverse engineering is excellent way for defense the modern botnets to immune valuable information by identifying the evidence behavior, log collection and digital forensics.

Many researchers contribute to the fight against network intrusions or malicious software by proposing novel detection systems or analysis methods. However, few of these solutions have a particular focus on Advanced Persistent Threats or similarly sophisticated multi-stage attacks. This turns finding domain-appropriate methodologies or developing new approaches into a major research challenge. To overcome these obstacles, we present a structured review of semantics-aware works that have a high potential for contributing to the analysis or detection of targeted attacks. We introduce a detailed literature evaluation schema in addition to a highly granular model for article categorization. Out of 123 identified papers, 60 were found to be relevant in the context of this study. The selected articles are comprehensively reviewed and assessed in accordance to Kitchenham’s guidelines for systematic literature reviews. In conclusion, we combine new insights and the status quo of current research into the concept of an ideal systemic approach capable of semantically processing and evaluating information from different observation points. © 2016, The Author(s).","APT; Intrusion detection; Malware; Security; Semantics-based attack detection; Targeted attacks","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Network security; Semantics; Attack detection; Conventional computers; Multi-stage attack; Network intrusions; Research challenges; Security; Systematic literature review; Targeted attacks; Malware",,,,,,,,"Abdoli, F., Kahani, M., Ontology-based distributed intrusion detection system (2009) Computer Conference, 2009.

On the other hand, cyber criminals and miscreants produced more advanced techniques to compromise Internet infrastructure. Targeted attack or advanced persistent threat (APT) attack is a new challenge and aims to accomplish a specific goal, most often espionage. APTs are presently the biggest threat to governments and organizations. This paper states research questions and propose a novel approach to intrusion detection system processes network traffic and able to detect potential APT attack. This detection of APT attack is based on the correlation between the events which we get as outputs of our detection methods.

However, this type of malware is less interesting to cyber security officers of larger organizations, who are more concerned with detecting malware indicative of a targeted attack. Here we investigate the potential of statistically based approaches to detect such malware using a malware family associated with a large number of targeted network intrusions. Our approach is complementary to the bulk of statistical based malware classifiers, which are typically based on measures of overall similarity between executable files. One problem with this approach is that a malicious executable that shares some, but limited, functionality with known malware is likely to be misclassified as benign. Here a new approach to malware classification is introduced that classifies programs based on their similarity with known malware subroutines. It is illustrated that malware and benign programs can share a substantial amount of code, implying that classification should be based on malicious subroutines that occur infrequently, or not at all in benign programs. Various approaches to accomplishing this task are investigated, and a particularly simple approach appears the most effective. This approach simply computes the fraction of subroutines of a program that are similar to malware subroutines whose likes have not been found in a larger benign set. If this fraction exceeds around 1.5 %, the corresponding program can be classified as malicious at a 1 in 1000 false alarm rate. It is further shown that combining a local and overall similarity based approach can lead to considerably better prediction due to the relatively low correlation of their predictions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag France (Outside the USA).","APT; Malware detection; Static analysis; Subroutine similarity","Computer crime; Computer viruses; Static analysis; Subroutines; APT; Executable files; False alarm rate; Malware classifications; Malware detection; Malware families; Network intrusions; Statistical detection; Malware",,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., Quist, D., Neil, J., Storlie, C., Lane, T., Graph-based malware detection using dynamic traces (2011) J.

Such an attack usually results in the loss of sensitive and confidential information. Because email communication is an integral part of daily business operations, APT attackers frequently leverage email as an attack vector for initial penetration of the targeted organization. Emails allow the attacker to deliver malicious attachments or links to malicious websites. Attackers usually use social engineering in order to make the recipient open the malicious email, open the attachment, or press a link. Existing defensive solutions within organizations prevent executables from entering organizational networks via emails, therefore, recent APT attacks tend to attach non-executable files (PDF, MS Office etc.) which are widely used in organizations and mistakenly considered less suspicious or malicious. This article surveys existing academic methods for the detection of malicious PDF files. The article outlines an Active Learning framework and highlights the correlation between structural incompatibility of PDF files and their likelihood of maliciousness. Finally, we provide comparisons, insights and conclusions, as well as avenues for future research in order to enhance the detection of malicious PDFs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","APT; Cyber-attack; Detection; Email; Malicious code; Malware; Organizations; PDF","Computer crime; Crime; Electronic mail; Error detection; Network security; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Business operation; Confidential information; Cyber-attacks; Email communication; Executable files; Malicious codes; Organizational network; Social engineering; Malware",,,,,"Ministry of Science, Technology and Space","This research was partly supported by the National Cyber Bureau of the Israeli Ministry of Science, Technology and Space .

APTs often use a variety of attack methods to get unauthorized system access initially and then gradually spread throughout the network. In contrast to traditional attacks, they are not used to interrupt services but primarily to steal intellectual property, sensitive internal business and legal documents and other data. If an attack on a system is successful, timely detection is of paramount importance to mitigate its impact and prohibit APTs from further spreading. However, recent security incidents, such as Operation Shady Rat, Operation Red October or the discovery of MiniDuke - just to name a few - have impressively demonstrated that current security mechanisms are mostly insufficient to prohibit targeted and customized attacks. This paper therefore proposes a novel anomaly detection approach which is a promising basis for modern intrusion detection systems. In contrast to other common approaches, which apply a kind of black-list approach and consider only actions and behaviour that match to well-known attack patterns and signatures of malware traces, our system works with a white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behaviour over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. In this work, we describe this system in theory and show evaluation results from a pilot study under real-world conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Since this attacking process is working continuously and uses diverse malicious codes and attacking routes, it is considered to be difficult to detect in advance. In this paper, we categorized cyber targeted attacks into four steps and defined potential behaviors of involvers like attackers or victims, in order to make a model. Each behavior of our model can include a couple of methods. Furthermore, we applied our behavior-based model to the real targeted attacks, ""3.20 South Korean Malware Attack"" and ""The Targeted Attack for SK Communications"".","3.20 DarkSeoul; APT; Behavior-based Modeling; Malicious Codes; Targeted Attacks","Command and control systems; Computer crime; Malware; 3.20 DarkSeoul; APT; Behavior based modeling; Malicious codes; Targeted Attacks; Security of data",,,,,,,,"Virvilis, N., Gritzalis, D., The big four-what we did wrong in protecting critical ICT infrastructures from Advanced Persistent Threat detection?

In the last decade, lot of research has been done, using machine learning methods on both static as well as dynamic analysis. Since the aim and objective of malware developers have changed from just for fame to political espionage or financial gain, the malware is also getting evolved in its form, and infection methods. One of the latest form of malware is known as targeted malware, on which not much research has happened. Targeted malware, which is a superset of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), is growing in its volume and complexity in recent years. Targeted Cyber attack (through targeted malware) plays an increasingly malicious role in disrupting the online social and financial systems. APTs are designed to steal corporate / national secrets and/or harm national/corporate interests. It is difficult to recognize targeted malware by antivirus, IDS, IPS and custom malware detection tools. Attackers leverage compelling social engineering techniques along with one or more zero day vulnerabilities for deploying APTs. Along with these, the recent introduction of Crypto locker and Ransom ware pose serious threats to organizations/nations as well as individuals. In this paper, we compare various machine-learning techniques used for analyzing malwares, focusing on static analysis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Advanced Persistent Threat; Cyber Defence; Machine Learning; Malware; Static Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Learning systems; Network security; Static analysis; Advanced Persistent Threat; Critical component; Cyber Defence; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Social engineering; Zero day vulnerabilities; Malware",,,,,,,,"The 'ICEFOG' APT: A tale of cloak and three daggers (2013) Kaspersky Lab Global Research and Analysis Team(GREAT); Balduzzi, M., Ciangaglini, V., McArdle, R., Targeted attacks detection with spunge (2013) Trend Micro Research, EMEA; Becker, G.T., Regazzoni, F., Paar, C., Burleson, W.P., (2013) Stealthy Dopant-level Hardware Trojans; Bencsáth, B., Pék, G., Buttyán, L., Félegyházi, M., The cousins of stuxnet: Duqu, flame, and gauss (2012) Future Internet, 4 (4), pp. 971-1003; Bilar, D., Opcodes as predictor for malware (2007) International Journal of Electronic Security and Digital Forensics, 1 (2), pp. 156-168; Blonce, A., Filiol, E., Frayssignes, L., (2008) Portable Document Format (pdf) Security Analysis and Malware Threats.
